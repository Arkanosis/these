abstract = {Although culture-independent techniques have refuted lung sterility in health, controversy about contamination during bronchoscope passage through the upper respiratory tract (URT) has impeded research progress. We sought to establish whether bronchoscopic sampling accurately reflects the lung microbiome in health and to distinguish between two proposed routes of authentic microbial immigration, (i) dispersion along contiguous respiratory mucosa and (ii) subclinical microaspiration. During bronchoscopy of eight adult volunteers without lung disease, we performed seven protected specimen brushings (PSB) and bilateral bronchoalveolar lavages (BALs) per subject. We amplified, sequenced, and analyzed the bacterial 16S rRNA gene V4 regions by using the Illumina MiSeq platform. Rigorous attention was paid to eliminate potential sources of error or contamination, including a randomized processing order and the inclusion and analysis of exhaustive procedural and sequencing control specimens. Indices of mouth-lung immigration (mouth-lung community similarity, bacterial burden, and community richness) were all significantly greater in airway and alveolar specimens than in bronchoscope contamination control specimens, indicating minimal evidence of pharyngeal contamination. Ecological indices of mouth-lung immigration peaked at or near the carina, as predicted for a primary immigration route of microaspiration. Bacterial burden, diversity, and mouth-lung similarity were greater in BAL than PSB samples, reflecting differences in the sampled surface areas. (This study has been registered at ClinicalTrials.gov under registration no. NCT02392182.)IMPORTANCE This study defines the bacterial topography of the healthy human respiratory tract and provides ecological evidence that bacteria enter the lungs in health primarily by microaspiration, with potential contribution in some subjects by direct dispersal along contiguous mucosa. By demonstrating that contamination contributes negligibly to microbial communities in bronchoscopically acquired specimens, we validate the use of bronchoscopy to investigate the lung microbiome.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Airway microbiota composition has been clearly correlated with many pulmonary diseases, and notably with cystic fibrosis (CF), an autosomal genetic disorder caused by mutation in the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). Recently, a new molecule, ivacaftor, has been shown to re-establish the functionality of the G551D-mutated CFTR, allowing significant improvement in lung function.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nOBJECTIVE AND METHODS: The purpose of this study was to follow the evolution of the airway microbiota in CF patients treated with ivacaftor, using quantitative PCR and pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA amplicons, in order to identify quantitative and qualitative changes in bacterial communities. Three G551D children were followed up longitudinally over a mean period of more than one year covering several months before and after initiation of ivacaftor treatment.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: 129 operational taxonomy units (OTUs), representing 64 genera, were identified. There was no significant difference in total bacterial load before and after treatment. Comparison of global community composition found no significant changes in microbiota. Two OTUs, however, showed contrasting dynamics: after initiation of ivacaftor, the relative abundance of the anaerobe Porphyromonas 1 increased (p{\textless}0.01) and that of Streptococcus 1 (S. mitis group) decreased (p{\textless}0.05), possibly in relation to the anti-Gram-positive properties of ivacaftor. The anaerobe Prevotella 2 correlated positively with the pulmonary function test FEV-1 (r=0.73, p{\textless}0.05). The study confirmed the presumed positive role of anaerobes in lung function.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: Several airway microbiota components, notably anaerobes (obligate or facultative anaerobes), could be valuable biomarkers of lung function improvement under ivacaftor, and could shed light on the pathophysiology of lung disease in CF patients.},

abstract = {Staphylococcus aureus is a common cause of bacterial infections in respiratory diseases. It secretes molecules to dampen host immunity, and the recently identified adenosine is one of these molecules. The type IIA secretory phospholipase A2 (sPLA2-IIA) is a host protein endowed with antibacterial properties, especially against Gram-positive bacteria such as S. aureus. However, the role of adenosine in sPLA2-IIA-mediated S. aureus killing by host is still unknown. The present studies showed that the S. aureus mutant lacking adenosine production (∆adsA strain) increased sPLA2-IIA expression in guinea pig airways and was cleared more efficiently, compared with the wild-type strain. S. aureus ∆adsA strain induced sPLA2-IIA expression by alveolar macrophages after phagocytic process via NOD2-NF-$\kappa$B-dependent mechanism. However, S. aureus adenosine (wild-type and adsA-complemented strains) and exogenous adenosine downregulated S. aureus phagocytosis by alveolar macrophages, leading to inhibition of sPLA2-IIA expression. This occurred through inhibition of p38 phosphorylation via adenosine receptors A2a-, A2b-, and protein kinase A-dependent pathways. Taken together, our studies suggest that, in the airway, S. aureus escapes sPLA2-IIA-mediated killing through adenosine-mediated inhibition of phagocytosis and sPLA2-IIA expression.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES Early detection of Pseudomonas aeruginosa lung positivity is a key element in cystic fibrosis (CF) management. PCR has increased the accuracy of detection of many microorganisms. Clinical relevance of P. aeruginosa quantitative PCR (qPCR) in this context is unclear. Our aim was to determine P. aeruginosa qPCR sensitivity and specificity, and to assess the possible time saved by qPCR in comparison with standard practice (culture). METHODS A multicentre cohort study was conducted over a 3-year period in 96 patients with CF without chronic P. aeruginosa colonization. Sputum samples were collected at each visit. Conventional culture and two-step qPCR (oprL qPCR and gyrB/ecfX qPCR) were performed for 707 samples. The positivity criteria were based on the qPCR results, defined in a previous study as follow: oprL qPCR positivity alone if bacterial density was {\textless}730 CFU/mL or oprL qPCR combined with gyrB/ecfX qPCR if bacterial density was ≥730 CFU/mL. RESULTS During follow up, 36 of the 96 patients with CF were diagnosed on culture as colonized with P. aeruginosa. This two-step qPCR displayed a sensitivity of 94.3{\%} (95{\%} CI 79.7{\%}-98.6{\%}), and a specificity of 86.3{\%} (95{\%} CI 83.4{\%}-88.7{\%}). It enabled P. aeruginosa acquisition to be diagnosed earlier in 20 patients, providing a median detection time gain of 8 months (interquartile range 3.7-17.6) for them. CONCLUSIONS Implementing oprL and gyrB/ecfX qPCR in the management of patients with CF allowed earlier detection of first P. aeruginosa lung positivity than culture alone.},

abstract = {In a process termed quorum sensing, bacteria use diffusible chemical signals to coordinate cell density-dependent gene expression. In the human pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa, quorum sensing controls hundreds of genes, many of which encode extracellular virulence factors. Quorum sensing is required for P. aeruginosa virulence in animal models. Curiously, quorum sensing-deficient variants, most of which carry a mutation in the gene encoding the central quorum sensing regulator lasR, are frequently isolated from acute and chronic infections. The mechanism for their emergence is not known. Here we provide experimental evidence suggesting that these lasR mutants are social cheaters that cease production of quorum-controlled factors and take advantage of their production by the group. We detected an emerging subpopulation of lasR mutants after approximately 100 generations of in vitro evolution of the P. aeruginosa wild-type strain under culture conditions that require quorum sensing for growth. Under such conditions, quorum sensing appears to impose a metabolic burden on the proliferating bacterial cell, because quorum-controlled genes not normally induced until cessation of growth were highly expressed early in growth, and a defined lasR mutant showed a growth advantage when cocultured with the parent strain. The emergence of quorum-sensing-deficient variants in certain environments is therefore an indicator of high quorum sensing activity of the bacterial population as a whole. It does not necessarily indicate that quorum sensing is insignificant, as has previously been suggested. Thus, novel antivirulence strategies aimed at disrupting bacterial communication may be particularly effective in such clinical settings.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND The miniaturised and portable DNA sequencer MinION™ has been released to the scientific community within the framework of an early access programme to evaluate its application for a wide variety of genetic approaches. This technology has demonstrated great potential, especially in genome-wide analyses. In this study, we tested the ability of the MinION™ system to perform amplicon sequencing in order to design new approaches to study microbial diversity using nearly full-length 16S rDNA sequences. RESULTS Using R7.3 chemistry, we generated more than 3.8 million events (nt) during a single sequencing run. These data were sufficient to reconstruct more than 90 {\%} of the 16S rRNA gene sequences for 20 different species present in a mock reference community. After read mapping and 16S rRNA gene assembly, consensus sequences and 2d reads were recovered to assign taxonomic classification down to the species level. Additionally, we were able to measure the relative abundance of all the species present in a mock community and detected a biased species distribution originating from the PCR reaction using 'universal' primers. CONCLUSIONS Although nanopore-based sequencing produces reads with lower per-base accuracy compared with other platforms, the MinION™ DNA sequencer is valuable for both high taxonomic resolution and microbial diversity analysis. Improvements in nanopore chemistry, such as minimising base-calling errors and the nucleotide bias reported here for 16S amplicon sequencing, will further deliver more reliable information that is useful for the specific detection of microbial species and strains in complex ecosystems.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Currently, bacterial 16S rRNA gene analyses are based on sequencing of individual variable regions of the 16S rRNA gene (Kozich, et al Appl Environ Microbiol 79:5112-5120, 2013).This short read approach can introduce biases. Thus, full-length bacterial 16S rRNA gene sequencing is needed to reduced biases. A new alternative for full-length bacterial 16S rRNA gene sequencing is offered by PacBio single molecule, real-time (SMRT) technology. The aim of our study was to validate PacBio P6 sequencing chemistry using three approaches: 1) sequencing the full-length bacterial 16S rRNA gene from a single bacterial species Staphylococcus aureus to analyze error modes and to optimize the bioinformatics pipeline; 2) sequencing the full-length bacterial 16S rRNA gene from a pool of 50 different bacterial colonies from human stool samples to compare with full-length bacterial 16S rRNA capillary sequence; and 3) sequencing the full-length bacterial 16S rRNA genes from 11 vaginal microbiome samples and compare with in silico selected bacterial 16S rRNA V1V2 gene region and with bacterial 16S rRNA V1V2 gene regions sequenced using the Illumina MiSeq. RESULTS Our optimized bioinformatics pipeline for PacBio sequence analysis was able to achieve an error rate of 0.007{\%} on the Staphylococcus aureus full-length 16S rRNA gene. Capillary sequencing of the full-length bacterial 16S rRNA gene from the pool of 50 colonies from stool identified 40 bacterial species of which up to 80{\%} could be identified by PacBio full-length bacterial 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Analysis of the human vaginal microbiome using the bacterial 16S rRNA V1V2 gene region on MiSeq generated 129 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) from which 70 species could be identified. For the PacBio, 36,000 sequences from over 58,000 raw reads could be assigned to a barcode, and the in silico selected bacterial 16S rRNA V1V2 gene region generated 154 OTUs grouped into 63 species, of which 62{\%} were shared with the MiSeq dataset. The PacBio full-length bacterial 16S rRNA gene datasets generated 261 OTUs, which were grouped into 52 species, of which 54{\%} were shared with the MiSeq dataset. Alpha diversity index reported a higher diversity in the MiSeq dataset. CONCLUSION The PacBio sequencing error rate is now in the same range of the previously widely used Roche 454 sequencing platform and current MiSeq platform. Species-level microbiome analysis revealed some inconsistencies between the full-length bacterial 16S rRNA gene capillary sequencing and PacBio sequencing.},

abstract = {Cystic fibrosis (CF) is the most common autosomal lethal recessive disorder in the Caucasian population. The major cause of mortality is lung disease, owing to the failure of a functional protein from the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene. Today, even though the knowledge about the CFTR genomic is extensive, no efficient treatment has been developed yet. In this context, gene therapy represents a potential important advance on condition that it could develop efficient and safe transfection agents. Even though viral vectors have been used in most clinical trials owing to their high transfection efficiency, random integration and immunogenicity are still critical side effects. Consequently, all of these drawbacks brought forth the development of nonviral transfection systems. Although they engender few toxicity and immunogenicity problems, their low transfection efficiency is a hurdle that must be overcome. Over the past decade, we have developed an original family of monocationic lipids, cationic phosphonolipids, whose efficiency has been previously demonstrated both in vitro and in vivo.

abstract = {After more than a century of active research, the notion that the human fetal environment is sterile and that the neonate's microbiome is acquired during and after birth was an accepted dogma. However, recent studies using molecular techniques suggest bacterial communities in the placenta, amniotic fluid, and meconium from healthy pregnancies. These findings have led many scientists to challenge the “sterile womb paradigm” and propose that microbiome acquisition instead begins in utero, an idea that would fundamentally change our understanding of gut microbiota acquisition and its role in human development. In this review, we provide a critical assessment of the evidence supporting these two opposing hypotheses, specifically as it relates to (i) anatomical, immunological, and physiological characteristics of the placenta and fetus; (ii) the research methods currently used to study microbial populations in the intrauterine environment; (iii) the fecal microbiome during the first days of life; and (iv) the generation of axenic animals and humans. Based on this analysis, we argue that the evidence in support of the “in utero colonization hypothesis” is extremely weak as it is founded almost entirely on studies that (i) used molecular approaches with an insufficient detection limit to study “low-biomass” microbial populations, (ii) lacked appropriate controls for contamination, and (iii) failed to provide evidence of bacterial viability. Most importantly, the ability to reliably derive axenic animals via cesarean sections strongly supports sterility of the fetal environment in mammals. We conclude that current scientific evidence does not support the existence of microbiomes within the healthy fetal milieu, which has implications for the development of clinical practices that prevent microbiome perturbations after birth and the establishment of future research priorities.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Analysis of cell-free foetal DNA (cff-DNA) in maternal plasma is very promising for early diagnosis of monogenic diseases; in particular, cystic fibrosis (CF). However, NIPD of single-gene disorders has been limited by the availability of suitable technical platforms and the need to set up patient or disease-specific custom-made approaches. METHODS To make research applications more readily accessible to the clinic, we offer a simple assay combining two independent methods to determine the presence or absence of paternally inherited foetal allele p.Phe508del (the most frequent mutation in CF patients worldwide). The first method detects the presence or absence of a p.Phe508del allele by Mutant Enrichment with 3'-Modified Oligonucleotide PCR coupled to Fragment Length Analysis (MEMO-PCR-FLA). The second method detects the p.Phe508del allele with classical Multiplex Fluorescent PCR including five intragenic and extragenic STR markers of the CFTR locus and a specific SRY sequence. RESULTS We collected 24 plasma samples from 23 women carrying foetuses at risk for CF and tested each sample using both methods. Our new procedures were successfully applied to 10 couples where fathers carried the p.Phe508del mutation and mothers were carrying a different mutation in the CFTR gene. These simple tests provided clear positive or negative results from the maternal plasma of the pregnant women. We confirmed the presence of cff-DNA in the studied samples by the identification of a tri-allelic DNA profile using a miniSTR kit. All results were correlated with chorionic villus sampling or amniocentesis analyses. CONCLUSIONS This NIPD approach, easily set up in any clinical laboratory where prenatal diagnosis is routinely performed, offers many advantages over current methods: it is simple, rapid, and cost-effective. It opens up the possibility for testing a large number of couples with offspring at risk for CF.},

Whether inflammation is part of the basic defect in CF or a response to persistent infection remains controversial.

This model yields histologically mature, and most importantly, naive CF and non-CF surrogate airways. Significant inflammatory imbalance was found in naive CF airway grafts, including a highly increased intraluminal interleukin 8 content (CF: 10.1 ± 2.2 ng/ml; non-CF: 1.2 ± 0.6 ng/ml; P {\textless} 0.05) and consistent accumulation of leukocytes in the subepithelial region (P {\textless} 0.001).

abstract = {Clustering is an unsupervised process to determine which unlabeled objects in a set share interesting properties. The objects are grouped into k subsets (clusters) whose elements optimize a proximity measure. Methods based on information theory have proven to be feasible alternatives. They are based on the assumption that a cluster is one subset with the minimal possible degree of ``disorder''. They attempt to minimize the entropy of each cluster. We propose a clustering method based on the maximum entropy principle. Such a method explores the space of all possible probability distributions of the data to find one that maximizes the entropy subject to extra conditions based on prior information about the clusters. The prior information is based on the assumption that the elements of a cluster are ``similar'' to each other in accordance with some statistical measure. As a consequence of such a principle, those distributions of high entropy that satisfy the conditions are favored over others. Searching the space to find the optimal distribution of object in the clusters represents a hard combinatorial problem, which disallows the use of traditional optimization techniques. Genetic algorithms are a good alternative to solve this problem. We benchmark our method relative to the best theoretical performance, which is given by the Bayes classifier when data are normally distributed, and a multilayer perceptron network, which offers the best practical performance when data are not normal. In general, a supervised classification method will outperform a non-supervised one, since, in the first case, the elements of the classes are known a priori. In what follows, we show that our method's effectiveness is comparable to a supervised one. This clearly exhibits the superiority of our method.},

This method, UniFrac, measures the phylogenetic distance between sets of taxa in a phylogenetic tree as the fraction of the branch length of the tree that leads to descendants from either one environment or the other, but not both. UniFrac can be used to determine whether communities are signifi- cantly different, to compare many communities simultaneously using clustering and ordination techniques, and to measure the relative contributions of different factors, such as chemistry and geography, to similarities between samples. We demonstrate the utility of UniFrac by applying it to published 16S rRNA gene libraries from cultured isolates and environmental clones of bacteria in marine sediment, water, and ice. Our results reveal that (i) cultured isolates from ice, water, and sediment resemble each other and environmental clone sequences from sea ice, but not environmental clone sequences from sediment and water; (ii) the geographical location does not correlate strongly with bacterial community differences in ice and sediment from the Arctic and Antarctic; and (iii) bacterial communities differ between terrestrially impacted seawater (whether polar or temperate) and warm oligotrophic seawater, whereas those in individual seawater samples are not more similar to each other than to those in sediment or ice samples. These results illustrate that UniFrac provides a new way of characterizing microbial communities, using the wealth of environmental rRNA sequences, and allows quantitative insight into the factors that underlie the distribution of lineages among environments.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Bronchiectasis is accompanied by chronic bronchial infection that may drive disease progression. However, the evidence base for antibiotic therapy is limited. DNA based methods offer better identification and quantification of microbial constituents of sputum than standard clinical culture and may help inform patient management strategies. Our study objective was to determine the longitudinal variability of the non-cystic fibrosis (CF) bronchiectasis microbiome in sputum with respect to clinical variables. Eighty-five patients with non-CF bronchiectasis and daily sputum production were recruited from outpatient clinics and followed for six months. Monthly sputum samples and clinical measurements were taken, together with additional samples during exacerbations. 16S rRNA gene sequencing of the sputum microbiota was successful for 381 samples from 76 patients and analysed in conjunction with clinical data. RESULTS Microbial communities were highly individual in composition and stability, usually with limited diversity and often containing multiple pathogens. When compared to DNA sequencing, microbial culture had restricted sensitivity in identifying common pathogens such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis. With some exceptions, community characteristics showed poor correlations with clinical features including underlying disease, antibiotic use and exacerbations, with the subject showing the strongest association with community structure. When present, the pathogens mucoid Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Haemophilus influenzae may also shape the structure of the rest of the microbial community. CONCLUSIONS The use of microbial community analysis of sputum added to information from microbial culture. A simple model of exacerbations driven by bacterial overgrowth was not supported, suggesting a need for revision of principles for antibiotic therapy. In individual patients, the management of chronic bronchial infection may be improved by therapy specific to their microbiome, taking into account pathogen load, community stability, and acute and chronic community responses to antibiotics.},

ABSTRACT The healthy lung has previously been considered to be a sterile organ because standard microbiological culture techniques consistently yield negative results. However, culture-independent techniques report that large numbers of microorganisms coexist in the lung. There are many unknown aspects in the field, but available reports show that the lower respiratory tract microbiota: 1) is similar in healthy subjects to the oropharyngeal microbiota and dominated by members of the Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria phyla; 2) shows changes in smokers and well-defined differences in chronic respiratory diseases, although the temporal and spatial kinetics of these changes are only partially known; and 3) shows relatively abundant non-cultivable bacteria in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, cystic fibrosis and bronchiectasis, with specific patterns for each disease. In all of these diseases, a loss of diversity, paralleled by an over-representation of Proteobacteria (dysbiosis), has been related to disease severity and exacerbations. However, it is unknown whether dysbiosis is a cause or a consequence of the damage to bronchoalveolar surfaces. Finally, little is known about bacterial functionality and the interactions between viruses, fungi and bacteria. It is expected that future research in bacterial gene expressions, metagenomics longitudinal analysis and host–microbiome animal models will help to move towards targeted microbiome interventions in respiratory diseases.},

In the past decade, the interest in the role of microbiome in maintaining lung health and in respiratory diseases has grown exponentially. The advent of sophisticated multiomics techniques has enabled the identification and characterisation of microbiota and their roles in respiratory health and disease. Furthermore, associations between the microbiome of the lung and gut, as well as the immune cells and mediators that may link these two mucosal sites, appear to be important in the pathogenesis of lung conditions. Here we review the recent evidence of the role of normal gastrointestinal and respiratory microbiome in health and how dysbiosis affects chronic pulmonary diseases. The potential implications of host and environmental factors such as age, gender, diet and use of antibiotics on the composition and overall functionality of microbiome are also discussed. We summarise how microbiota may mediate the dynamic process of immune development and/or regulation focusing on recent data from both clinical human studies and translational animal studies. This furthers the understanding of the pathogenesis of chronic pulmonary diseases and may yield novel avenues for the utilisation of microbiota as potential therapeutic interventions.},

The need to maintain lung function in these patients means that characterising these infections is vital. Increasingly, culture-independent analyses are expanding the number of bacterial species associated with CF respiratory samples; however, the potential significance of these species is not known. Here, we applied ecological statistical tools to such culture-independent data, in a novel manner, to partition taxa within the metacommunity into core and satellite species. Sputa and clinical data were obtained from 14 clinically stable adult CF patients. Fourteen rRNA gene libraries were constructed with 35 genera and 82 taxa, identified in 2139 bacterial clones. Shannon-Wiener and taxa-richness analyses confirmed no undersampling of bacterial diversity. By decomposing the distribution using the ratio of variance to the mean taxon abundance, we partitioned objectively the species abundance distribution into core and satellite species. The satellite group comprised 67 bacterial taxa from 33 genera and the core group, 15 taxa from 7 genera (including Pseudomonas (1 taxon), Streptococcus (2), Neisseria (2), Catonella (1), Porphyromonas (1), Prevotella (5) and Veillonella (3)], the last four being anaerobes). The core group was dominated by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Other recognised CF pathogens were rare. Mantel and partial Mantel tests assessed which clinical factors influenced the composition observed. CF transmembrane conductance regulator genotype and antibiotic treatment correlated with all core taxa. Lung function correlated with richness. The clinical significance of these core and satellite species findings in the CF lung is discussed. GenBank accession numbers: FM995625–FM997761},

abstract = {RATIONALE Pulmonary infection in cystic fibrosis (CF) is polymicrobial and it is possible that anaerobic bacteria, not detected by routine aerobic culture methods, reside within infected anaerobic airway mucus. OBJECTIVES To determine whether anaerobic bacteria are present in the sputum of patients with CF. METHODS Sputum samples were collected from clinically stable adults with CF and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) samples from children with CF. Induced sputum samples were collected from healthy volunteers who did not have CF. All samples were processed using anaerobic bacteriologic techniques and bacteria within the samples were quantified and identified. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Anaerobic species primarily within the genera Prevotella, Veillonella, Propionibacterium, and Actinomyces were isolated in high numbers from 42 of 66 (64{\%}) sputum samples from adult patients with CF. Colonization with Pseudomonas aeruginosa significantly increased the likelihood that anaerobic bacteria would be present in the sputum. Similar anaerobic species were identified in BALF from pediatric patients with CF. Although anaerobes were detected in induced sputum samples from 16 of 20 volunteers, they were present in much lower numbers and were generally different species compared with those detected in CF sputum. Species-dependent differences in the susceptibility of the anaerobes to antibiotics with known activity against anaerobes were apparent with all isolates susceptible to meropenem. CONCLUSIONS A range of anaerobic species are present in large numbers in the lungs of patients with CF. If these anaerobic bacteria are contributing significantly to infection and inflammation in the CF lung, informed alterations to antibiotic treatment to target anaerobes, in addition to the primary infecting pathogens, may improve management.},

abstract = {Current therapy for cystic fibrosis (CF) focuses on minimizing the microbial community and the host's immune response through the aggressive use of airway clearance techniques, broad-spectrum antibiotics, and treatments that break down the pervasive endobronchial biofilm. Antibiotic selection is typically based on the susceptibility of individual microbial strains to specific antibiotics in vitro. Often this approach cannot accurately predict medical outcomes because of factors both technical and biological. Recent culture-independent assessments of the airway microbial and viral communities demonstrated that the CF airway infection is considerably more complex and dynamic than previously appreciated. Understanding the ecological and evolutionary pressures that shape these communities is critically important for the optimal use of current therapies (in both the choice of therapy and timing of administration) and the development of newer strategies. The climax-attack model (CAM) presented here, grounded in basic ecological principles, postulates the existence of two major functional communities. The attack community consists of transient viral and microbial populations that induce strong innate immune responses. The resultant intense immune response creates microenvironments that facilitate the establishment of a climax community that is slower-growing and inherently resistant to antibiotic therapy. Newer methodologies, including sequence-based metagenomic analysis, can track not only the taxonomic composition but also the metabolic capabilities of these changing viral and microbial communities over time. Collecting this information for CF airways will enable the mathematical modeling of microbial community dynamics during disease progression. The resultant understanding of airway communities and their effects on lung physiology will facilitate the optimization of CF therapies.},

abstract = {The lung microbiome, which is believed to be stable or at least transient in healthy people, is now considered as a poly-microorganism component contributing to disease pathogenesis. Most research studies on the respiratory microbiome have focused on bacteria and their impact on lung health, but there is evidence that other non-bacterial organisms, comprising the viruses (virome) and fungi (mycobiome), are also likely to play an important role in healthy people as well as in patients. In the last few years, the lung mycobiome (previously named the fungal microbiota or microbiome) has drawn closer attention. There is growing evidence that the lung mycobiome has a significant impact on clinical outcome of chronic respiratory diseases (CRD) such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cystic fibrosis, and bronchiectasis. Thanks to advances in culture independent methods, especially next generation sequencing, a number of fungi not detected by culture methods have been molecularly identified in human lungs. It has been shown that the structure and diversity of the lung mycobiome vary in different populations (healthy and different diseased individuals) which could play a role in CRD. Moreover, the link between lung mycobiome and different biomes of other body sites, especially the gut, has also been unraveled. By interacting with the bacteriome and/or virome, the respiratory mycobiome appears to be a cofactor in inflammation and in the host immune response, and therefore may contribute to the decline of the lung function and the disease progression. In this review, we report the recent limited explorations of the human respiratory mycobiome, and discuss the mycobiome's connections with other local microbial communities, as well as the relationships with the different biomes of other body sites. These studies suggest several outlooks for this understudied emerging field, which will certainly call for a renewal of our understanding of pulmonary diseases.},

abstract = {The human microbiome has emerged as a major player in regulating human health and disease. Translational studies of the microbiome have the potential to indicate clinical applications such as fecal transplants and probiotics. However, one major issue is accurate identification of microbes constituting the microbiota. Studies of the microbiome have frequently utilized sequencing of the conserved 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene. We present a comparative study of an alternative approach using whole genome shotgun sequencing (WGS). In the present study, we analyzed the human fecal microbiome compiling a total of 194.1 × 10(6) reads from a single sample using multiple sequencing methods and platforms. Specifically, after establishing the reproducibility of our methods with extensive multiplexing, we compared: 1) The 16S rRNA amplicon versus the WGS method, 2) the Illumina HiSeq versus MiSeq platforms, 3) the analysis of reads versus de novo assembled contigs, and 4) the effect of shorter versus longer reads. Our study demonstrates that whole genome shotgun sequencing has multiple advantages compared with the 16S amplicon method including enhanced detection of bacterial species, increased detection of diversity and increased prediction of genes. In addition, increased length, either due to longer reads or the assembly of contigs, improved the accuracy of species detection.},

abstract = {16S ribosomal RNA gene (rDNA) amplicon analysis remains the standard approach for the cultivation-independent investigation of microbial diversity. The accuracy of these analyses depends strongly on the choice of primers. The overall coverage and phylum spectrum of 175 primers and 512 primer pairs were evaluated in silico with respect to the SILVA 16S/18S rDNA non-redundant reference dataset (SSURef 108 NR). Based on this evaluation a selection of 'best available' primer pairs for Bacteria and Archaea for three amplicon size classes (100-400, 400-1000, ≥ 1000 bp) is provided. The most promising bacterial primer pair (S-D-Bact-0341-b-S-17/S-D-Bact-0785-a-A-21), with an amplicon size of 464 bp, was experimentally evaluated by comparing the taxonomic distribution of the 16S rDNA amplicons with 16S rDNA fragments from directly sequenced metagenomes. The results of this study may be used as a guideline for selecting primer pairs with the best overall coverage and phylum spectrum for specific applications, therefore reducing the bias in PCR-based microbial diversity studies.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Prokaryotic 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) sequences are widely used in environmental microbiology and molecular evolution as reliable markers for the taxonomic classification and phylogenetic analysis of microbes. Restricted by current sequencing techniques, the massive sequencing of 16S rRNA gene amplicons encompassing the full length of genes is not yet feasible. Thus, the selection of the most efficient hypervariable regions for phylogenetic analysis and taxonomic classification is still debated. In the present study, several bioinformatics tools were integrated to build an in silico pipeline to evaluate the phylogenetic sensitivity of the hypervariable regions compared with the corresponding full-length sequences. RESULTS The correlation of seven sub-regions was inferred from the geodesic distance, a parameter that is applied to quantitatively compare the topology of different phylogenetic trees constructed using the sequences from different sub-regions. The relationship between different sub-regions based on the geodesic distance indicated that V4-V6 were the most reliable regions for representing the full-length 16S rRNA sequences in the phylogenetic analysis of most bacterial phyla, while V2 and V8 were the least reliable regions. CONCLUSIONS Our results suggest that V4-V6 might be optimal sub-regions for the design of universal primers with superior phylogenetic resolution for bacterial phyla. A potential relationship between function and the evolution of 16S rRNA is also discussed.},

abstract = {Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a pleiotropic disease, originating from mutations in the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). Lung injuries inflicted by recurring infection and excessive inflammation cause approximately 90{\%} of the morbidity and mortality of CF patients. It remains unclear how CFTR mutations lead to lung illness. Although commonly known as a Cl(-) channel, CFTR also conducts thiocyanate (SCN(-)) ions, important because, in several ways, they can limit potentially harmful accumulations of hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) and hypochlorite (OCl(-)). First, lactoperoxidase (LPO) in the airways catalyzes oxidation of SCN(-) to tissue-innocuous hypothiocyanite (OSCN(-)), while consuming H(2)O(2). Second, SCN(-) even at low concentrations competes effectively with Cl(-) for myeloperoxidase (MPO) (which is released by white blood cells), thus limiting OCl(-) production by the enzyme. Third, SCN(-) can rapidly reduce OCl(-) without catalysis. Here, we show that SCN(-) and LPO protect a lung cell line from injuries caused by H(2)O(2); and that SCN(-) protects from OCl(-) made by MPO. Of relevance to inflammation in other diseases, we find that in three other tested cell types (arterial endothelial cells, a neuronal cell line, and a pancreatic beta cell line) SCN(-) at concentrations of {\textgreater} or =100 microM greatly attenuates the cytotoxicity of MPO. Humans naturally derive SCN(-) from edible plants, and plasma SCN(-) levels of the general population vary from 10 to 140 microM. Our findings raise the possibility that insufficient levels of antioxidant SCN(-) provide inadequate protection from OCl(-), thus worsening inflammatory diseases, and predisposing humans to diseases linked to MPO activity, including atherosclerosis, neurodegeneration, and certain cancers.},

Although vitamins are present in a variety of foods, deficiencies still occur, mainly due to malnutrition as a result of insufficient food intake and because of poor eating habits. Fermented milks with high levels of B-group vitamins (such as folate and riboflavin) can be produced by LAB-promoted and possibly bifidobacteria-promoted biosynthesis. Moreover, certain strains of LAB produce the complex vitamin cobalamin (or vitamin B12). In this review, fermented foods with elevated levels of B-group vitamins produced by LAB used as starter cultures will be covered. In addition, genetic abilities for vitamin biosynthesis by selected human gut commensals will be discussed.},

abstract = {Human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) are a family of structurally diverse unconjugated glycans that are highly abundant in and unique to human milk. Originally, HMOs were discovered as a prebiotic "bifidus factor" that serves as a metabolic substrate for desired bacteria and shapes an intestinal microbiota composition with health benefits for the breast-fed neonate. Today, HMOs are known to be more than just "food for bugs". An accumulating body of evidence suggests that HMOs are antiadhesive antimicrobials that serve as soluble decoy receptors, prevent pathogen attachment to infant mucosal surfaces and lower the risk for viral, bacterial and protozoan parasite infections. In addition, HMOs may modulate epithelial and immune cell responses, reduce excessive mucosal leukocyte infiltration and activation, lower the risk for necrotizing enterocolitis and provide the infant with sialic acid as a potentially essential nutrient for brain development and cognition. Most data, however, stem from in vitro, ex vivo or animal studies and occasionally from association studies in mother-infant cohorts. Powered, randomized and controlled intervention studies will be needed to confirm relevance for human neonates. The first part of this review introduces the pioneers in HMO research, outlines HMO structural diversity and describes what is known about HMO biosynthesis in the mother's mammary gland and their metabolism in the breast-fed infant. The second part highlights the postulated beneficial effects of HMO for the breast-fed neonate, compares HMOs with oligosaccharides in the milk of other mammals and in infant formula and summarizes the current roadblocks and future opportunities for HMO research.},

abstract = {Pulmonary exacerbations account for much of the decrease in lung function and consequently most of the morbidity and mortality in patients with cystic fibrosis. These events are driven by an acute inflammatory response to infection. Recent technological advancements in molecular profiling techniques have allowed for a proliferation of microbiome studies of the lower airways of patients with cystic fibrosis. But these methods may not provide a comprehensive and unbiased measure of the lung microbiota in these patients and molecular profiles do not always translate to quantitative microbiology. Furthermore, these studies have not yet been able to provide much in the way of mechanistic insights into exacerbations or to guide patient therapy. We propose a model in which pulmonary exacerbations may be driven by an active subpopulation of the lung microbiota, which may represent only a small portion of the microbiota measured in a clinical sample. Methodology should be focused on the ultimate goal, which is to use the best available approaches to provide accurate quantitative measures of the microbiome to inform clinical decisions and provide rapid assessment of treatment efficacy. These strategies would be relevant to other chronic lung diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and neutrophilic asthma.},

abstract = {Recent work using culture-independent methods suggests that the lungs of cystic fibrosis (CF) patients harbor a vast array of bacteria not conventionally implicated in CF lung disease. However, sampling lung secretions in living subjects requires that expectorated specimens or collection devices pass through the oropharynx. Thus, contamination could confound results. Here, we compared culture-independent analyses of throat and sputum specimens to samples directly obtained from the lungs at the time of transplantation. We found that CF lungs with advanced disease contained relatively homogenous populations of typical CF pathogens. In contrast, upper-airway specimens from the same subjects contained higher levels of microbial diversity and organisms not typically considered CF pathogens. Furthermore, sputum exhibited day-to-day variation in the abundance of nontypical organisms, even in the absence of clinical changes. These findings suggest that oropharyngeal contamination could limit the accuracy of DNA-based measurements on upper-airway specimens. This work highlights the importance of sampling procedures for microbiome studies and suggests that methods that account for contamination are needed when DNA-based methods are used on clinical specimens.},

abstract = {Cystic fibrosis (CF) manifests in the lungs resulting in chronic microbial infection. Most morbidity and mortality in CF is due to cycles of pulmonary exacerbations-episodes of acute inflammation in response to the lung microbiome-which are difficult to prevent and treat because their cause is not well understood. We hypothesized that longitudinal analyses of the bacterial component of the CF lung microbiome may elucidate causative agents within this community for pulmonary exacerbations. In this study, 6 participants were sampled thrice-weekly for up to one year. During sampling, sputum, and data (antibiotic usage, spirometry, and symptom scores) were collected. Time points were categorized based on relation to exacerbation as Stable, Intermediate, and Treatment. Retrospectively, a subset of were interrogated via 16S rRNA gene sequencing. When samples were examined categorically, a significant difference between the lung microbiota in Stable, Intermediate, and Treatment samples was observed in a subset of participants. However, when samples were examined longitudinally, no correlations between microbial composition and collected data (antibiotic usage, spirometry, and symptom scores) were observed upon exacerbation onset. In this study, we identified no universal indicator within the lung microbiome of exacerbation onset but instead showed that changes to the CF lung microbiome occur outside of acute pulmonary episodes and are patient-specific.},

abstract = {The structure and dynamics of bacterial communities in the airways of persons with cystic fibrosis (CF) remain largely unknown. We characterized the bacterial communities in 126 sputum samples representing serial collections spanning 8-9 y from six age-matched male CF patients. Sputum DNA was analyzed by bar-coded pyrosequencing of the V3-V5 hypervariable region of the 16S rRNA gene, defining 662 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) from {\textgreater}633,000 sequences. Bacterial community diversity decreased significantly over time in patients with typically progressive lung disease but remained relatively stable in patients with a mild lung disease phenotype. Antibiotic use, rather than patient age or lung function, was the primary driver of decreasing diversity. Interpatient variability in community structure exceeded intrapatient variability in serial samples. Antibiotic treatment was associated with pronounced shifts in community structure, but communities showed both short- and long-term resilience after antibiotic perturbation. There was a positive correlation between OTU occurrence and relative abundance, with a small number of persistent OTUs accounting for the greatest abundance. Significant changes in community structure, diversity, or total bacterial density at the time of pulmonary exacerbation were not observed. Despite decreasing community diversity in patients with progressive disease, total bacterial density remained relatively stable over time. These findings show the critical relationship between airway bacterial community structure, disease stage, and clinical state at the time of sample collection. These features are the key parameters with which to assess the complex ecology of the CF airway.},

abstract = {Background: Given the polymicrobial nature of pulmonary infections in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF), it is essential to enhance our knowledge on the composition of the microbial community to improve patient management. In this study, we developed a pyrosequencing approach to extensively explore the diversity and dynamics of fungal and prokaryotic populations in CF lower airways. Methodology and Principal Findings: Fungi and bacteria diversity in eight sputum samples collected from four adult CF patients was investigated using conventional microbiological culturing and high-throughput pyrosequencing approach targeting the ITS2 locus and the 16S rDNA gene. The unveiled microbial community structure was compared to the clinical profile of the CF patients. Pyrosequencing confirmed recently reported bacterial diversity and observed complex fungal communities, in which more than 60{\%} of the species or genera were not detected by cultures. Strikingly, the diversity and species richness of fungal and bacterial communities was significantly lower in patients with decreased lung function and poor clinical status. Values of Chao1 richness estimator were statistically correlated with values of the Shwachman-Kulczycki score, body mass index, forced vital capacity, and forced expiratory volume in 1 s (p = 0.046, 0.047, 0.004, and 0.001, respectively for fungal Chao1 indices, and p = 0.010, 0.047, 0.002, and 0.0003, respectively for bacterial Chao1 values). Phylogenetic analysis showed high molecular diversities at the sub-species level for the main fungal and bacterial taxa identified in the present study. Anaerobes were isolated with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which was more likely to be observed in association with Candida albicans than with Aspergillus fumigatus. Conclusions: In light of the recent concept of CF lung microbiota, we viewed the microbial community as a unique pathogenic entity. We thus interpreted our results to highlight the potential interactions between microorganisms and the role of fungi in the context of improving survival in CF.},

abstract = {Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic bacteria causing a wide variety of nosocomial infections. The expression of virulence genes in the infection site plays an important pathophysiological role. The transcription of several virulence genes of P. aeruginosa is controlled by a regulatory mechanism depending on bacterial density, named quorum-sensing (QS). Two QS systems, las and rhl, were identified in P. aeruginosa. Each system is defined by a couple of a regulation protein and an autoinducer enzyme: LasR/LasI and RhlR/RhlI for the las and rhlr QS systems, respectively. The autoinducer enzyme contributes to the synthesis of small molecules, the acyl homoserin lactones (AHLs) which easily diffuse through bacterial membranes. When they reach a critical level, the AHLs are linked to the regulation protein. The resulting complex activates the transcription of multiple virulence genes. This activation can amplify and synchronise the virulence of the whole bacterial population. The AHLs also have an immuno-modulation activity, which plays a role in the pathophysiology of the infection. The role of the QS was experimentally demonstrated in different animal models of P. aeruginosa infections. In humans, the expression of the QS and the presence of AHL were detected in respiratory specimens of cystic fibrosis patients infected by P. aeruginosa. The effect of QS in other types of infection requires further studies. As a whole, the knowledge of the molecular mechanisms of QS offers the opportunity to develop new therapeutic targets to attenuate the virulence of strains during P. aeruginosa infections. {\textcopyright} 2004 Soci{\'{e}}t{\'{e}} de r{\'{e}}animation de langue fran{\c{c}}aise.

At the present time, there are significant methodologic and technical hurdles that must be addressed in ongoing investigations, including distinguishing the microbiota of the upper and lower respiratory tracts. However, characterization of the lung microbiome is likely to provide important pathogenic insights into cystic fibrosis, respiratory disease of the newborn, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and asthma. In addition to characterization of the lung microbiome, the microbiota of the gastrointestinal tract have profound influence on development and maintenance of lung immunity and inflammation. Further study of gastrointestinal-respiratory interactions are likely to yield important insights into the pathogenesis of pulmonary diseases, including asthma. As this field advances over the next several years, we anticipate that studies utilizing larger cohorts, multi-center designs, and longitudinal sampling will add to our knowledge and understanding of the lung microbiome.},

abstract = {The major therapeutic strategy used to treat exacerbated cystic fibrosis (CF) is antibiotic treatment. As this approach easily generates antibiotic-resistant strains of opportunistic bacteria, optimized antibiotic therapies are required to effectively control chronic and recurrent bacterial infections in CF patients. A promising future for the proper use of antibiotics is the management of lung microbiota. However, the impact of antibiotic treatments on CF microbiota and vice versa is not fully understood. This study analyzed 718 sputum samples from 18 previous studies to identify differences between CF and uninfected lung microbiota and to evaluate the effects of antibiotic treatments on exacerbated CF microbiota. A reference-based OTU (operational taxonomic unit) picking method was used to combine analyses of data generated using different protocols and platforms. Findings show that CF microbiota had greater richness and lower diversity in the community structure than uninfected control (NIC) microbiota. Specifically, CF microbiota showed higher levels of opportunistic bacteria and dramatically lower levels of commensal bacteria. Antibiotic treatment affected exacerbated CF microbiota notably but only transiently during the treatment period. Limited decrease of the dominant opportunistic bacteria and a dramatic decrease of commensal bacteria were observed during the antibiotic treatment for CF exacerbation. Simultaneously, low abundance opportunistic bacteria were thriving after the antibiotic treatment. The inefficiency of the current antibiotic treatment against major opportunistic bacteria and the detrimental effects on commensal bacteria indicate that the current empiric antibiotic treatment on CF exacerbation should be reevaluated and optimized.},

Specific sites in the respiratory tract contain specialized bacterial communities that are thought to have a major role in the maintenance of human health. In the past decade, next‑generation sequencing has led to major advances in our understanding of the possible functions of the resident microbiota. So far, research has largely focused on the gut microbiota and gut microbiota‑derived metab‑ olites, and their influence on host metabolism and immu‑ nity. However, recent studies on microbial ecosystems at other body sites, including the respiratory tract, reveal an even broader role for the microbiota in human health 1 . The respiratory tract is a complex organ system that is divided into the upper respiratory tract (URT) and the lower respiratory tract (LRT). The URT includes the anterior nares, nasal passages, paranasal sinuses, the naso‑ pharynx and oropharynx, and the portion of the larynx above the vocal cords, whereas the LRT includes the portion of the larynx below the vocal cords, the trachea, smaller airways (that is, bronchi and bronchioli) and alveoli. The primary function of the respiratory tract in human physiology is the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide. For this purpose, the adult human airways have a surface area of approximately 70 m 2},

abstract = {Cystic fibrosis (CF) manifests in the lungs resulting in chronic microbial infection. Most mor-bidity and mortality in CF is due to cycles of pulmonary exacerbations—episodes of acute inflammation in response to the lung microbiome—which are difficult to prevent and treat because their cause is not well understood. We hypothesized that longitudinal analyses of the bacterial component of the CF lung microbiome may elucidate causative agents within this community for pulmonary exacerbations. In this study, 6 participants were sampled thrice-weekly for up to one year. During sampling, sputum, and data (antibiotic usage, spi-rometry, and symptom scores) were collected. Time points were categorized based on rela-tion to exacerbation as Stable, Intermediate, and Treatment. Retrospectively, a subset of were interrogated via 16S rRNA gene sequencing. When samples were examined categori-cally, a significant difference between the lung microbiota in Stable, Intermediate, and Treat-ment samples was observed in a subset of participants. However, when samples were examined longitudinally, no correlations between microbial composition and collected data (antibiotic usage, spirometry, and symptom scores) were observed upon exacerbation onset. In this study, we identified no universal indicator within the lung microbiome of exacerbation onset but instead showed that changes to the CF lung microbiome occur out-side of acute pulmonary episodes and are patient-specific.},

Although aerosolization of Tobramycin into the airway of CF patients improves outcomes, the lungs of CF patients, even those receiving antibiotic therapy, are persistently colonized by P. aeruginosa. Recent studies suggest that the antibiotic resistance of P. aeruginosa in the CF lung is due to the formation of drug resistant biofilms, which are defined as communities of microbes associated with surfaces or interfaces, and whose growth is facilitated by thick and dehydrated mucus in the CF lung. In this review, we discuss some of the current models used to study biofilm formation in the context of biotic surfaces, such as airway cells, as well as the contribution of host-derived factors, including DNA, actin and mucus, to the formation of these microbial communities. We suggest that better in vitro models are required, both to understand the interaction of P. aeruginosa with the host airway, and as models to validate new therapeutics, whether targeted at bacteria or host.},

Here, we provide a proof of principle for disease monitoring using personal metagenomic sequencing and traditional clinical microbiology by focusing on three adults with cystic fibrosis (CF). The CF lung is a dynamic environment that hosts a complex ecosystem composed of bacteria, viruses, and fungi that can vary in space and time. Not surprisingly, the microbiome data from the induced sputum samples we collected revealed a significant amount of species diversity not seen in routine clinical laboratory cultures. The relative abundances of several species changed as clinical treatment was altered, enabling the identification of the climax and attack communities that were proposed in an earlier work. All patient microbiomes encoded a diversity of mechanisms to resist antibiotics, consistent with the characteristics of multidrug-resistant microbial communities that are commonly observed in CF patients. The metabolic potentials of these communities differed by the health status and recovery route of each patient. Thus, this pilot study provides an example of how metagenomic data might be used with clinical assessments for the development of treatments tailored to individual patients.},

Here we describe Serial Illumina Sequencing (SI-Seq): a method for deep sequencing of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene using next-generation sequencing technology. SI-Seq serially sequences portions of the V5, V6 and V7 hypervariable regions from barcoded 16S rRNA amplicons using an Illumina short-read genome analyzer. SI-Seq obtains taxonomic resolution similar to 454 pyrosequencing for a fraction of the cost, and can produce hundreds of thousands of reads per sample even with very high multiplexing. We validated SI-Seq using single species and mock community controls, and via a comparison to cystic fibrosis lung microbiota sequenced using 454 FLX Titanium. Our control runs show that SI-Seq has a dynamic range of at least five orders of magnitude, can classify .96{\%} of sequences to the genus level, and performs just as well as 454 and paired-end Illumina methods in estimation of standard microbial ecology diversity measurements. We illustrate the utility of SI-Seq in a pilot sample of central airway secretion samples from cystic fibrosis patients.},

@article{Whiteson2014,
abstract = {The airways of cystic fibrosis (CF) patients are chronically colonized by patient-specific polymicrobial communities. The conditions and nutrients available in CF lungs affect the physiology and composition of the colonizing microbes. Recent work in bioreactors has shown that the fermentation product 2,3-butanediol mediates cross-feeding between some fermenting bacteria and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and that this mechanism increases bacterial current production. To examine bacterial fermentation in the respiratory tract, breath gas metabolites were measured and several metagenomes were sequenced from CF and non-CF volunteers. 2,3-butanedione was produced in nearly all respiratory tracts. Elevated levels in one patient decreased during antibiotic treatment, and breath concentrations varied between CF patients at the same time point. Some patients had high enough levels of 2,3-butanedione to irreversibly damage lung tissue. Antibiotic therapy likely dictates the activities of 2,3-butanedione-producing microbes, which suggests a need for further study with larger sample size. Sputum microbiomes were dominated by P. aeruginosa, Streptococcus spp. and Rothia mucilaginosa, and revealed the potential for 2,3-butanedione biosynthesis. Genes encoding 2,3-butanedione biosynthesis were disproportionately abundant in Streptococcus spp, whereas genes for consumption of butanedione pathway products were encoded by P. aeruginosa and R. mucilaginosa. We propose a model where low oxygen conditions in CF lung lead to fermentation and a decrease in pH, triggering 2,3-butanedione fermentation to avoid lethal acidification. We hypothesize that this may also increase phenazine production by P. aeruginosa, increasing reactive oxygen species and providing additional electron acceptors to CF microbes.},

abstract = {The opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa causes a variety of infections in immunocompromised individuals, including individuals with the heritable disease cystic fibrosis. Like the carbon sources metabolized by many disease-causing bacteria, the carbon sources metabolized by P. aeruginosa at the host infection site are unknown. We recently reported that l-alanine is a preferred carbon source for P. aeruginosa and that two genes potentially involved in alanine catabolism (dadA and dadX) are induced during in vivo growth in the rat peritoneum and during in vitro growth in sputum (mucus) collected from the lungs of individuals with cystic fibrosis. The goals of this study were to characterize factors required for alanine catabolism in P. aeruginosa and to assess the importance of these factors for in vivo growth. Our results reveal that dadA and dadX are arranged in an operon and are required for catabolism of l-alanine. The dad operon is inducible by l-alanine, d-alanine, and l-valine, and induction is dependent on the transcriptional regulator Lrp. Finally, we show that a mutant unable to catabolize dl-alanine displays decreased competitiveness in a rat lung model of infection.},

abstract = {Culture-independent microbiological techniques have shown a previously unappreciated complexity to the bacterial microbiome of the respiratory tract that forces reconsideration of the interactions between host, bacteria, and the pathogenesis of exacerbations of chronic lung disease. The composition of the lung microbiome is determined by microbial immigration, elimination, and relative growth rates of its members. All these factors change dramatically in chronic lung disease and further during exacerbations. Exacerbations lack the features of bacterial infections, including increased bacterial burden and decreased diversity of microbial communities. We propose that exacerbations are occasions of respiratory tract dysbiosis--a disorder of the respiratory tract microbial ecosystem with negative effects on host biology. Respiratory tract dysbiosis provokes a dysregulated host immune response, which in turn alters growth conditions for microbes in airways, promoting further dysbiosis and perpetuating a cycle of inflammation and disordered microbiota. Differences in the composition of baseline respiratory tract microbiota might help to explain the so-called frequent-exacerbator phenotype observed in several disease states, and might provide novel targets for therapeutic intervention.},

The aim of the present study was to evaluate this definition in the current authors' paediatric and adult CF clinic using clinical, immunological and lung function parameters. During follow-up, out of 193 patients, 55 (34{\%}) CF patients had never been infected with Pa, 27 (17{\%}) were free of Pa, 29 (18{\%}) were intermittently infected and 51 (31{\%}) were chronically infected. Disease severity markers, such as lung function, were significantly worse in the chronic group, especially in the paediatric population. Differences in adult patients were smaller and no longer significant. Pa antibodies differed strongly between the groups, and were very high (mean+/-sd 55.4+/-5.5) and highly statistically significant from all other groups in the chronic group. They were low and different from all other groups in the never group (1.8+/-0.6). Pa antibodies did not differ between the free of Pa and the intermittent group. In conclusion, the current authors confirmed an agreement between Pseudomonas aeruginosa status according to the new definition and clinical status, as well as with the level of Pseudomonas aeruginosa antibodies.},

abstract = {Background: The lung of patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) is particularly sensitive to Pseudomonas aeruginosa. This bacterium plays an important role in the poor outcome of CF patients. During the disease progress, first acquisition of P. aeruginosa is the key-step in the management of CF patients. Quantitative PCR (qPCR) offers an opportunity to detect earlier the first acquisition of P. aeruginosa by CF patients. Given the lack of a validated protocol, our goal was to find an optimal molecular protocol for detection of P. aeruginosa in CF patients. Methods: We compared two formerly described qPCR formats in early detection of P. aeruginosa in CF sputum samples: a qPCR targeting oprL gene, and a multiplex PCR targeting gyrB and ecfX genes. Results: Tested in vitro on a large panel of P. aeruginosa isolates and others gram-negative bacilli, oprL qPCR exhibited a better sensitivity (threshold of 10 CFU/mL versus 730 CFU/mL), whereas the gyrB/ecfX qPCR exhibited a better specificity (90{\%} versus 73{\%}). These results were validated ex vivo on 46 CF sputum samples positive for P. aeruginosa in culture. Ex vivo assays revealed that qPCR detected 100 times more bacterial cells than culture-based method did. Conclusion: Based on these results, we proposed a reference molecular protocol combining the two qPCRs, which offers a sensitivity of 100{\%} with a threshold of 10 CFU/mL and a specificity of 100{\%}. This combined qPCR-based protocol can be adapted and used for other future prospective studies.},

The CF lung microbiota shows significant inter-individual variability in community structure, composition and diversity. The core microbiota consists of five genera - Streptococcus, Prevotella, Rothia, Veillonella and Actinomyces. CF-associated pathogens such as Pseudomonas, Burkholderia, Stenotrophomonas and Achromobacter are less prevalent than core genera, but have a strong tendency to dominate the bacterial community when present. Community diversity and lung function are greatest in patients less than 10 years of age and lower in older age groups, plateauing at approximately age 25. Lower community diversity correlates with worse lung function in a multivariate regression model. Infection by Pseudomonas correlates with age-associated trends in community diversity and lung function.},

We used 16S ribosomal RNA sequencing to characterize the lung microbiota in 269 CF patients spanning a 60 year age range, including 76 pediatric samples from patients of age 4-17, and a broad cross-section of disease status to identify features of bacterial community structure and their relationship to disease stage and age. The CF lung microbiota shows significant inter-individual variability in community structure, composition and diversity. The core microbiota consists of five genera - Streptococcus, Prevotella, Rothia, Veillonella and Actinomyces. CF-associated pathogens such as Pseudomonas, Burkholderia, Stenotrophomonas and Achromobacter are less prevalent than core genera, but have a strong tendency to dominate the bacterial community when present. Community diversity and lung function are greatest in patients less than 10 years of age and lower in older age groups, plateauing at approximately age 25. Lower community diversity correlates with worse lung function in a multivariate regression model. Infection by Pseudomonas correlates with age-associated trends in community diversity and lung function.},

La colonisation des voies a{\'{e}}riennes par Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa) est fr{\'{e}}quente chez les patients atteints de mucoviscidose. Elle contribue {\`{a}} aggraver les signes respiratoires. Toutefois, pour des raisons qui restent encore {\`{a}} explorer, certains patients restent indemnes de cette colonisation jusqu'{\`{a}} l'{\^{a}}ge adulte (sujets class{\'{e}}s « never »). L'objectif de notre {\'{e}}tude, baptis{\'{e}}e PYOnever, {\'{e}}tait de pr{\'{e}}ciser les caract{\'{e}}ristiques cliniques, g{\'{e}}n{\'{e}}tiques et microbiologiques de ces adultes dits « never ». 

M{\'{E}}THODES
Les param{\`{e}}tres cliniques, g{\'{e}}n{\'{e}}tiques et microbiologiques de 2130 patients {\^{a}}g{\'{e}}s de plus de 20ans ont {\'{e}}t{\'{e}} analys{\'{e}}s r{\'{e}}trospectivement {\`{a}} partir des donn{\'{e}}es enregistr{\'{e}}es dans le registre fran{\c{c}}ais de la mucoviscidose entre janvier 2013 et d{\'{e}}cembre 2014. Les groupes « never » et « pyo » (sujets ayant des expectorations positives {\`{a}} P. aeruginosa) ont {\'{e}}t{\'{e}} compar{\'{e}}s par r{\'{e}}gression logistique. Les param{\`{e}}tres avec un p{\textless}0,05 en analyse bi-vari{\'{e}}e ont {\'{e}}t{\'{e}} inclus dans le mod{\`{e}}le multivari{\'{e}} (mod{\`{e}}le de r{\'{e}}gression logistique avec s{\'{e}}lection de variables par la m{\'{e}}thode backward). 

R{\'{E}}SULTATS
Apr{\`{e}}s analyse multivari{\'{e}}e et prise en compte de l'{\^{a}}ge, du sexe, de l'insuffisance pancr{\'{e}}atique, du diab{\`{e}}te et de l'aspergillose broncho-pulmonaire allergique ; l'absence de la mutation F508del {\`{a}} l'{\'{e}}tat homozygote sur le g{\`{e}}ne CFTR et l'{\^{a}}ge au diagnostic de la maladie {\'{e}}taient apparus significativement associ{\'{e}}s {\`{a}} une absence de colonisation par P. aeruginosa {\`{a}} l'{\^{a}}ge adulte (OR=3,75, IC 95 {\%} : [1,4–10,05] ; OR=1,03, IC 95 {\%} : [1,01–1,05] respectivement). Sur le plan microbiologique, la pr{\'{e}}sence de S. aureus et H. influenzae dans les pr{\'{e}}l{\`{e}}vements respiratoires {\'{e}}tait significativement plus {\'{e}}lev{\'{e}}e dans le groupe « never », apr{\`{e}}s ajustement sur l'{\^{a}}ge au diagnostic et le VEMS. Par contre, concernant A. xylosoxidans, Aspergillus, B. cepacia et S. maltophilia, leur absence {\'{e}}tait associ{\'{e}}e au groupe « never ». 

CONCLUSION
L'absence de la mutation F508del {\`{a}} l'{\'{e}}tat homozygote et l'{\^{a}}ge {\'{e}}lev{\'{e}} au moment du diagnostic de la mucoviscidose sont des pr{\'{e}}dicteurs ind{\'{e}}pendants de l'absence de colonisation pulmonaire par P. aeruginosa.},

La primo-d{\'{e}}tection de Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) dans les s{\'{e}}cr{\'{e}}tions respiratoires des enfants atteints de mucoviscidose marque un tournant dans l'histoire de la maladie. L'origine de cette acquisition reste controvers{\'{e}}e. L'objectif de cette {\'{e}}tude est d'identifier des facteurs environnementaux influen{\c{c}}ant la primo-d{\'{e}}tection pr{\'{e}}coce {\`{a}} PA durant les deux premi{\`{e}}res ann{\'{e}}es de vie chez les enfants atteint de mucoviscidose. 

M{\'{E}}THODES
Nous avons r{\'{e}}alis{\'{e}} une {\'{e}}tude de cohorte r{\'{e}}trospective monocentrique chez 129 patients ag{\'{e}}s de 2 {\`{a}} 22ans suivis au CRCM p{\'{e}}diatrique du CHRU de Nancy. Un questionnaire environnemental a {\'{e}}t{\'{e}} distribu{\'{e}} {\`{a}} l'ensemble des parents des patients. Notre population a {\'{e}}t{\'{e}} divis{\'{e}}e en un groupe de 34 patients ayant eu une primo-d{\'{e}}tection {\`{a}} PA pr{\'{e}}coce avant l'{\^{a}}ge de 2ans et un groupe de 95 patients n'ayant pas eu de primo-d{\'{e}}tection {\`{a}} PA. 

R{\'{E}}SULTATS
Le groupe de patients ayant eu une primo-d{\'{e}}tection pr{\'{e}}coce {\`{a}} PA avait significativement un diagnostic de mucoviscidose plus pr{\'{e}}coce (1,5mois vs. 23,4mois ; p=0,0017). Ils {\'{e}}taient plus souvent diagnostiqu{\'{e}}s suite au d{\'{e}}pistage n{\'{e}}onatal (14,7 {\%} vs. 6,4 {\%} ; p=0,0453). Le chlore sudoral {\'{e}}tait plus {\'{e}}lev{\'{e}} au diagnostic (104,1mmol/l vs 88mmol/l ; p=0,0222). Ils {\'{e}}taient plus fr{\'{e}}quemment homozygote pour la mutation F508del (61,8 {\%} vs. 40,9 {\%} ; p=0,0452). Ils avaient {\'{e}}galement un nombre plus {\'{e}}lev{\'{e}} de bact{\'{e}}ries dans leurs s{\'{e}}cr{\'{e}}tions respiratoires (1,8 vs. 1,3 ; p=0,0317), de Staphylocoque aureus meticilline sensible (60 {\%} vs. 33,7 {\%} ; p=0,0177) et d'Haemophilus influenzae (80 {\%} vs. 51,6 {\%} ; p=0,0061). Il ne ressort pas de facteurs environnementaux int{\'{e}}rieurs et/ou ext{\'{e}}rieurs corr{\'{e}}l{\'{e}}s avec l'acquisition pr{\'{e}}coce de PA. 

CONCLUSION
Nous n'avons pu retrouv{\'{e}} de facteur de risque environnemental de primo-d{\'{e}}tection pr{\'{e}}coce {\`{a}} PA. Malgr{\'{e}} cela, la source de PA primitive se trouverait bien dans l'environnement quotidien des patients atteints de mucoviscidose {\'{e}}tant donn{\'{e}} son habitat aquatique. La contamination est certainement plurifactorielle quel que soit l'{\^{a}}ge. Les limites de cette {\'{e}}tude n{\'{e}}cessitent d'{\^{e}}tre prudent quant aux r{\'{e}}sultats. Les r{\`{e}}gles d'hygi{\`{e}}ne pr{\'{e}}conis{\'{e}}s dans le cadre de la prise en charge globale de la mucoviscidose ne doivent pas devenir une obsession ou emp{\^{e}}cher les parents de patients de vivre une vie sociale la plus normale possible.},

abstract = {Sarah Ng and colleagues first showed that whole-exome sequencing (WES -sequencing of all the exons in the genome) can be used to identify disease genes in 2009 [1]. Clearly, WES represents a revolutionary technology. In light of the ever increasing number of novel disease genes that have been discovered with WES, it has almost come to seem routine, and in fact the first descriptions of applications of WES to make clinical decisions in the care of patients have begun to appear [2]. The article by Lisenka Vissers and colleagues in the December 2010 issue of Nature Genetics [3] demonstrates that the revo-lution is far from over. By providing convincing evidence that WES can be used to detect de novo mutations in patients with sporadic cases of non-syndromic mental retardation, the authors [3] have extended the range of clinical situations in which WES can be used and given suggestive evidence that de novo mutations are a common cause of mental retardation.},

abstract = {Repeated pulmonary exacerbation and progressive lung function decline characterize cystic fibrosis (CF) disease, and represents one of the leading causes of mortality in this patient population. Recent studies have shown, using culture-independent assays, that multiple microbial species can be detected in airway samples from CF patients. Moreover, specific groups of bacteria within these bacterial communities or microbiota, are highly associated with disease-associated factors such as antibiotic administration. This raises the possibility that, as in other human niches, pathogenic processes in the CF airways represent polymicrobial activities and that microbiome composition and perturbations to these communities define patient pulmonary health status. Airway samples are typically collected through the mouth, and are thus susceptible to contamination by upper airway secretions; hence, caution must be exercised in interpreting these data. Nonetheless, given the continuum of the upper and lower respiratory tract, understanding the contribution of these mixed-species assemblages to airway health is essential to improving CF patient care. This article aims to discuss recent advances in the field of CF airway microbiome research and interpret these findings in the context of CF pulmonary disease.},

abstract = {For a long time, the human lower airways were considered a sterile environment where the presence of microorganisms, typically revealed by culturing, was interpreted as an abnormal health state. More recently, high-throughput sequencing-based studies have led to a shift in this perception towards the notion that even in healthy conditions the lower airways show either transient presence or even permanent colonization by microorganisms. However, challenges related to low biomass and contamination in samples still remain, and the composition, structure and dynamics of such putative microbial communities are unclear. Here, we review the evidence for the presence of microbial communities in the human lower airways, in healthy subjects and within the context of medical conditions of interest. We also provide an overview of the methodology pertinent to high-throughput sequencing studies, specifically those based on amplicon sequencing, including a discussion of good practices and common pitfalls.},

abstract = {| Each individual harbours a unique set of commensal microorganisms, collectively referred to as the microbiota. Notably, these microorganisms exceed the number of cells in the human body by 10-fold. This finding has accelerated a shift in our understanding of human physiology, with the realization that traits necessary for health are both encoded and influenced by the human genome and the microbiota. Our understanding of the aetiology of complex diseases has, therefore, evolved with increasing awareness that the human microbiota has an active and critical role in maintaining health and inducing disease. Indeed, findings from bioinformatic studies indicate that the microbiota and microbiome have multiple effects on the innate and adaptive immune systems, with effects on infection, autoimmune disease and cancer. In this Review, we first address the important statistical and informatics aspects that should be considered when characterizing the composition of microbiota. We next highlight the effects of the microbiota on the immune system and the implications of these effects on organ failure and transplantation. Finally, we reflect on the future perspectives for studies of the microbiota, including novel diagnostic tests and therapeutics.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Evaluating lymphocytic infiltration of minor salivary gland biopsy in primary Sj{\"{o}}gren's syndrome is challenging. We developed and evaluated a digital method for quantifying B and T lymphocytes in whole minor salivary gland biopsy slides. METHODS Minor salivary gland biopsies were immunostained with anti-CD20/anti-CD3 antibodies using red/brown chromogens. Slides were digitised and spliced into mosaics of smaller JPEG format images in which red and brown pixels were counted. ImageJ Cell counter was used for validation. Agreement between the digital and manual methods was evaluated using Bland-Altman plots and the interclass correlation coefficient. External validation relied on the Chisholm-Mason, Tarpley, and focus-score methods. RESULTS Of 62 minor salivary gland biopsy slides, 61.3 {\%} had a Chisholm-Mason grade ≥ III or a focus score ≥1. The number of pixels correlated well with manual cell counts (r = 0.95 for red pixels vs. B cell count and r = 0.91 for brown pixels vs. T cell count). Interclass correlation coefficients between digital and manual counts were excellent (0.92 for B/T cells). B-cell proportion showed a significant positive correlation with the focus score (Spearman's coefficient 0.463, p {\textless} 0.0001). Median B-cell proportion was lower in minor salivary gland biopsies with Chisholm grades I-II (2.5 {\%} (0.2-13.9)) than III-IV (30.0 {\%} (15.5-45.2)) and increased with Tarpley's class (1, 2.2 {\%} (0.2-6.6); 2, 27.2 {\%} (13.0-38.9); and 3-4, 48.5 {\%} (29.4-56.4); p {\textless} 0.001 for all comparisons). Minor salivary gland biopsy B-cell proportion was also significantly correlated with several markers of clinical and biological activity of the disease, especially with markers of systemic B-cell hyperactivation. CONCLUSION The digital procedure proved accurate compared to the reference standard, producing reliable results for whole tissue sections. TRIAL REGISTRATION ClinicalTrials.gov [ NCT00740948 ].

abstract = {Bacterial diversity among environmental samples is commonly assessed with PCR-amplified 16S rRNA gene (16S) se-quences. Perceived diversity, however, can be influenced by sample preparation, primer selection, and formation of chimeric 16S amplification products. Chimeras are hybrid products between multiple parent sequences that can be falsely interpreted as novel organisms, thus inflating apparent diversity. We developed a new chimera detection tool called Chimera Slayer (CS). CS detects chimeras with greater sensitivity than previous methods, performs well on short se-quences such as those produced by the 454 Life Sciences (Roche) Genome Sequencer, and can scale to large data sets. By benchmarking CS performance against sequences derived from a controlled DNA mixture of known organisms and a simulated chimera set, we provide insights into the factors that affect chimera formation such as sequence abundance, the extent of similarity between 16S genes, and PCR conditions. Chimeras were found to reproducibly form among independent amplifications and contributed to false perceptions of sample diversity and the false identification of novel taxa, with less-abundant species exhibiting chimera rates exceeding 70{\%}. Shotgun metagenomic sequences of our mock community appear to be devoid of 16S chimeras, supporting a role for shotgun metagenomics in validating novel or-ganisms discovered in targeted sequence surveys. [Supplemental material is available for this article. The sequence data from this study have been submitted to the NCBI Entrez Genome Project database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomeprj) under ID nos. 48465, 48471, 53501, and 60767. Software tools and data sets are freely available at http://microbiomeutil.sourceforge.net.] The analysis of 16S rRNA (16S) genes has become an essential component of the microbial ecologist's tool kit to evaluate the microbial composition of diverse habitats such as soils, oceans, and our own bodies. The high-sequence conservation of 16S genes among diverse bacteria allows for the phylogenetic analysis of or-ganism diversity and the identification of new taxa. The majority of bacterial phyla are known only from 16S surveys and have no cultured representatives (Rappe and Giovannoni 2003; Wu et al. 2009). Several online resources host large, curated collections of 16S sequences, including GreenGenes (DeSantis et al. 2006a), the Ribosomal Database Project (RDP) (Cole et al. 2009), SILVA (Pruesse et al. 2007), and EZ-Taxon (Chun et al. 2007). Despite efforts by the curators to remove low-quality sequences from survey data, it is likely that many of these reference sequences reflect sequencing artifacts rather than real biological diversity.},

abstract = {The fungal component of the human gut microbiota has been neglected for long time due to the low relative abundance of fungi with respect to bacteria, and only recently few reports have explored its composition and dynamics in health or disease. The application of metagenomics methods to the full understanding of fungal communities is currently limited by the under representation of fungal DNA with respect to the bacterial one, as well as by the limited ability to discriminate passengers from colonizers. Here, we investigated the gut mycobiota of a cohort of healthy subjects in order to reduce the gap of knowledge concerning fungal intestinal communities in the healthy status further screening for phenotypical traits that could reflect fungi adaptation to the host. We studied the fecal fungal populations of 111 healthy subjects by means of cultivation on fungal selective media and by ampliconbased ITS1 metagenomics analysis on a subset of 57 individuals. We then characterized the isolated fungi for their tolerance to gastrointestinal (GI) tractlike challenges and their susceptibility to antifungals. A total of 34 different fungal species were isolated showing several phenotypic characteristics associated with intestinal environment such as tolerance to body temperature (37 • C), to acidic and oxidative stress, and to bile salts exposure. We found a high frequency of azoles resistance in fungal isolates, with potential and significant clinical impact. Analyses of fungal communities revealed that the human gut mycobiota differs in function of individuals' life stage in a genderrelated fashion. The combination of metagenomics and fungal cultivation allowed an indepth understanding of the fungal intestinal community structure associated to the healthy status and the commensalismrelated traits of isolated fungi. We further discussed comparatively the results of sequencing and cultivation to critically evaluate the application of metagenomicsbased approaches to fungal gut populations.},

abstract = {We have previously demonstrated that haplotypes of three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the first intron of the OCA2 gene are extremely strongly associated with variation in human eye color. In the present work, we describe additional fine association mapping of eye color SNPs in the intergenic region upstream of OCA2 and within the neighboring HERC2 (hect domain and RLD2) gene. We screened an additional 92 SNPs in 300-3000 European individuals and found that a single SNP in intron 86 of HERC2, rs12913832, predicted eye color significantly better (ordinal logistic regression R2 = 0.68, association LOD = 444) than our previous best OCA2 haplotype. Comparison of sequence alignments of multiple species showed that this SNP lies in the center of a short highly conserved sequence and that the blue-eye-associated allele (frequency 78{\%}) breaks up this conserved sequence, part of which forms a consensus binding site for the helicase-like transcription factor (HLTF). We were also able to demonstrate the OCA2 R419Q, rs1800407, coding SNP acts as a penetrance modifier of this new HERC2 SNP for eye color, and somewhat independently, of melanoma risk. We conclude that the conserved region around rs12913832 represents a regulatory region controlling constitutive expression of OCA2 and that the C allele at rs12913832 leads to decreased expression of OCA2, particularly within iris melanocytes, which we postulate to be the ultimate cause of blue eye color. ?? 2008 The American Society of Human Genetics.},

abstract = {The presence of melanin pigment within the iris is responsible for the visual impression of human eye colouration with complex patterns also evident in this tissue, including Fuchs' crypts, nevi, Wolfflin nodules and contraction furrows. The genetic basis underlying the determination and inheritance of these traits has been the subject of debate and research from the very beginning of quantitative trait studies in humans. Although segregation of blue-brown eye colour has been described using a simple Mendelian dominant-recessive gene model this is too simplistic, and a new molecular genetic perspective is needed to fully understand the biological complexities of this process as a polygenic trait. Nevertheless, it has been estimated that 74{\%} of the variance in human eye colour can be explained by one interval on chromosome 15 that contains the OCA2 gene. Fine mapping of this region has identified a single base change rs12913832 T/C within intron 86 of the upstream HERC2 locus that explains almost all of this association with blue-brown eye colour. A model is presented whereby this SNP, serving as a target site for the SWI/SNF family member HLTF, acts as part of a highly evolutionary conserved regulatory element required for OCA2 gene activation through chromatin remodelling. Major candidate genes possibly effecting iris patterns are also discussed, including MITF and PAX6.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

Does local adaptation target the same genes in related species? Do loci responsible for local adaptation exhibit tradeoffs across environments?

abstract = {We present a performance-optimized algorithm, subsampled open-reference OTU picking, for assigning marker gene (e.g., 16S rRNA) sequences generated on next-generation sequencing platforms to operational taxonomic units (OTUs) for microbial community analysis. This algorithm provides benefits over de novo OTU picking (clustering can be performed largely in parallel, reducing runtime) and closed-reference OTU picking (all reads are clustered, not only those that match a reference database sequence with high similarity). Because more of our algorithm can be run in parallel relative to “classic” open-reference OTU picking, it makes open-reference OTU picking tractable on massive amplicon sequence data sets (though on smaller data sets, “classic” open-reference OTU clustering is often faster). We illustrate that here by applying it to the first 15,000 samples sequenced for the Earth Microbiome Project (1.3 billion V4 16S rRNA amplicons). To the best of our knowledge, this is the largest OTU picking run ever performed, and we estimate that our new algorithm runs in less than 1/5 the time than would be required of “classic” open reference OTU picking. We show that subsampled open-reference OTU picking yields results that are highly correlated with those generated by “classic” open-reference OTU picking through comparisons on three well-studied datasets. An implementation of this algorithm is provided in the popular QIIME software package, which uses uclust for read clustering. All analyses were performed using QIIME's uclust wrappers, though we provide details (aided by the open-source code in our GitHub repository) that will allow implementation of subsampled open-reference OTU picking independently of QIIME (e.g., in a compiled programming language, where runtimes should be further reduced). Our analyses should generalize to other implementations of these OTU picking algorithms. Finally, we present a comparison of parameter settings in QIIME's OTU picking workflows and make recommendations on settings for these free parameters to optimize runtime without reducing the quality of the results. These optimized parameters can vastly decrease the runtime of uclust-based OTU picking in QIIME.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: The Nearest Alignment Space Termination (NAST) tool is commonly used in sequence-based microbial ecology community analysis, but due to the limited portability of the original implementation, it has not been as widely adopted as possible. Python Nearest Alignment Space Termination (PyNAST) is a complete reimplementation of NAST, which includes three convenient interfaces: a Mac OS X GUI, a command-line interface and a simple application programming interface (API). RESULTS: The availability of PyNAST will make the popular NAST algorithm more portable and thereby applicable to datasets orders of magnitude larger by allowing users to install PyNAST on their own hardware. Additionally because users can align to arbitrary template alignments, a feature not available via the original NAST web interface, the NAST algorithm will be readily applicable to novel tasks outside of microbial community analysis. AVAILABILITY: PyNAST is available at http://pynast.sourceforge.net.},

abstract = {Next generation sequencing can be used to search for Mendelian disease genes in an unbiased manner by sequencing the entire protein-coding sequence, known as the exome, or even the entire human genome. Identifying the pathogenic mutation amongst thousands to millions of genomic variants is a major challenge, and novel variant prioritization strategies are required. The choice of these strategies depends on the availability of well-phenotyped patients and family members, the mode of inheritance, the severity of the disease and its population frequency. In this review, we discuss the current strategies for Mendelian disease gene identification by exome resequencing. We conclude that exome strategies are successful and identify new Mendelian disease genes in approximately 60{\%} of the projects. Improvements in bioinformatics as well as in sequencing technology will likely increase the success rate even further. Exome sequencing is likely to become the most commonly used tool for Mendelian disease gene identification for the coming years.},

abstract = {Advances in next-generation sequencing (NGS) have allowed significant breakthroughs in microbial ecology studies. This has led to the rapid expansion of research in the field and the establishment of "metagenomics", often defined as the analysis of DNA from microbial communities in environmental samples without prior need for culturing. Many metagenomics statistical/computational tools and databases have been developed in order to allow the exploitation of the huge influx of data. In this review article, we provide an overview of the sequencing technologies and how they are uniquely suited to various types of metagenomic studies. We focus on the currently available bioinformatics techniques, tools, and methodologies for performing each individual step of a typical metagenomic dataset analysis. We also provide future trends in the field with respect to tools and technologies currently under development. Moreover, we discuss data management, distribution, and integration tools that are capable of performing comparative metagenomic analyses of multiple datasets using well-established databases, as well as commonly used annotation standards.},

abstract = {As the sequencing of healthy and disease genomes becomes more commonplace, detailed annotation provides interpretation for individual variation responsible for normal and disease phenotypes. Current approaches focus on direct changes in protein coding genes, particularly nonsynonymous mutations that directly affect the gene product. However, most individual variation occurs outside of genes and, indeed, most markers generated from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) identify variants outside of coding segments. Identification of potential regulatory changes that perturb these sites will lead to a better localization of truly functional variants and interpretation of their effects. We have developed a novel approach and database, RegulomeDB, which guides interpretation of regulatory variants in the human genome. RegulomeDB includes high-throughput, experimental data sets from ENCODE and other sources, as well as computational predictions and manual annotations to identify putative regulatory potential and identify functional variants. These data sources are combined into a powerful tool that scores variants to help separate functional variants from a large pool and provides a small set of putative sites with testable hypotheses as to their function. We demonstrate the applicability of this tool to the annotation of noncoding variants from 69 full sequenced genomes as well as that of a personal genome, where thousands of functionally associated variants were identified. Moreover, we demonstrate a GWAS where the database is able to quickly identify the known associated functional variant and provide a hypothesis as to its function. Overall, we expect this approach and resource to be valuable for the annotation of human genome sequences.},

Nonhereditary tumors may involve the same mutation in somatic cells rather than germ cells. In neither case is this mutation alone sufficient to produce a tumor, and evidence is presented that a second mutational step is required in the initiation process. Individuals who bear these mutations germinally are extremely susceptible to specific tumors, they may develop more than one tumor, and the average age at onset is earlier than usual. Recessive genes for cancer susceptibility and environmental carcinogens may interact with each other and with these dominant "cancer genes" to increase the probability that cancer mutations will occur.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Myeloproliferative disorders are characterized by clonal expansion of normal mature blood cells. Acquired mutations giving rise to constitutive activation of the JAK2 tyrosine kinase has been shown to be present in the majority of patients. Since the demonstration that the V617F mutation in the exon 14 of the JAK2 gene is present in about 90{\%} of patients with Polycythemia Vera (PV), the detection of this mutation has become a key tool for the diagnosis of these patients. More recently, additional mutations in the exon 12 of the JAK2 gene have been described in 5 to 10{\%} of the patients with erythrocytosis. According to the updated WHO criteria the presence of these mutations should be looked for in PV patients with no JAK2 V617F mutation. Reliable and accurate methods dedicated to the detection of these highly variable mutations are therefore necessary.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS/FINDINGS: For these reasons we have defined the conditions of a High Resolution DNA Melting curve analysis (HRM) method able to detect JAK2 exon 12 mutations. After having validated that the method was able to detect mutated patients, we have verified that it gave reproducible results in repeated experiments, on DNA extracted from either total blood or purified granulocytes. This HRM assay was further validated using 8 samples bearing different mutant sequences in 4 different laboratories, on 3 different instruments.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: The assay we have developed is thus a valid method, adapted to routine detection of JAK2 exon 12 mutations with highly reproducible results.},

abstract = {Cancer primarily develops because of somatic alterations in the genome. Advances in sequencing have enabled large-scale sequencing studies across many tumor types, emphasizing the discovery of alterations in protein-coding genes. However, the protein-coding exome comprises less than 2{\%} of the human genome. Here we analyze the complete genome sequences of 863 human tumors from The Cancer Genome Atlas and other sources to systematically identify noncoding regions that are recurrently mutated in cancer. We use new frequency- and sequence-based approaches to comprehensively scan the genome for noncoding mutations with potential regulatory impact. These methods identify recurrent mutations in regulatory elements upstream of PLEKHS1, WDR74 and SDHD, as well as previously identified mutations in the TERT promoter. SDHD promoter mutations are frequent in melanoma and are associated with reduced gene expression and poor prognosis. The non-protein-coding cancer genome remains widely unexplored, and our findings represent a step toward targeting the entire genome for clinical purposes.},

This method constructs the background model by assessing coding-silent mutations, which are assumed not to be under positive selection and thus may reflect the baseline tendency of somatic mutations to be clustered. OncodriveCLUST analysis of the Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer retrieved a list of genes enriched by the Cancer Gene Census, prioritizing those with dominant phenotypes but also highlighting some recessive cancer genes, which showed wider but still delimited mutation clusters. Assessment of datasets from The Cancer Genome Atlas demonstrated that OncodriveCLUST selected cancer genes that were nevertheless missed by methods based on frequency and functional impact criteria. This stressed the benefit of combining approaches based on complementary principles to identify driver mutations.

We analyzed 800 cancer genomes of eight types to find single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) that precisely target phosphorylation machinery, important in cancer development and drug targeting. Assuming that cancer-related biological systems involve unexpectedly frequent mutations, we used novel algorithms to identify genes with significant phosphorylation-associated SNVs (pSNVs), phospho-mutated pathways, kinase networks, drug targets, and clinically correlated signaling modules. We highlight increased survival of patients with TP53 pSNVs, hierarchically organized cancer kinase modules, a novel pSNV in EGFR, and an immune-related network of pSNVs that correlates with prolonged survival in ovarian cancer. Our findings include multiple actionable cancer gene candidates (FLNB, GRM1, POU2F1), protein complexes (HCF1, ASF1), and kinases (PRKCZ).

abstract = {Identifying cancer driver genes and pathways among all somatic mutations detected in a cohort of tumors is a key challenge in cancer genomics. Traditionally, this is done by prioritizing genes according to the recurrence of alterations that they bear. However, this approach has some known limitations, such as the difficulty to correctly estimate the background mutation rate, and the fact that it cannot identify lowly recurrently mutated driver genes. Here we present a novel approach, Oncodrive-fm, to detect candidate cancer drivers which does not rely on recurrence. First, we hypothesized that any bias toward the accumulation of variants with high functional impact observed in a gene or group of genes may be an indication of positive selection and can thus be used to detect candidate driver genes or gene modules. Next, we developed a method to measure this bias (FM bias) and applied it to three datasets of tumor somatic variants. As a proof of concept of our hypothesis we show that most of the highly recurrent and well-known cancer genes exhibit a clear FM bias. Moreover, this novel approach avoids some known limitations of recurrence-based approaches, and can successfully identify lowly recurrent candidate cancer drivers.},

To explore cancer genomic alterations and their diversity comprehensively, global and local cancer genome-sequencing projects, including ICGC and TCGA, have been analyzing many types of cancer genomes mainly by exome sequencing. However, there is limited information on somatic mutations in non-coding regions including untranslated regions, introns, regulatory elements and non-coding RNAs, and rearrangements, sometimes producing fusion genes, and pathogen detection in cancer genomes remain widely unexplored. WGS approaches can detect these unexplored mutations, as well as coding mutations and somatic copy number alterations, and help us to better understand the whole landscape of cancer genomes and elucidate functions of these unexplored genomic regions. Analysis of cancer genomes using the present WGS platforms is still primitive and there are substantial improvements to be made in sequencing technologies, informatics and computer resources. Taking account of the extreme diversity of cancer genomes and phenotype, it is also required to analyze much more WGS data and integrate these with multi-omics data, functional data and clinical-pathological data in a large number of sample sets to interpret them more fully and efficiently.Oncogene advance online publication, 30 March 2015; doi:10.1038/onc.2015.90.},

abstract = {Major international projects are underway that are aimed at creating a comprehensive catalogue of all the genes responsible for the initiation and progression of cancer. These studies involve the sequencing of matched tumour-normal samples followed by mathematical analysis to identify those genes in which mutations occur more frequently than expected by random chance. Here we describe a fundamental problem with cancer genome studies: as the sample size increases, the list of putatively significant genes produced by current analytical methods burgeons into the hundreds. The list includes many implausible genes (such as those encoding olfactory receptors and the muscle protein titin), suggesting extensive false-positive findings that overshadow true driver events. We show that this problem stems largely from mutational heterogeneity and provide a novel analytical methodology, MutSigCV, for resolving the problem. We apply MutSigCV to exome sequences from 3,083 tumour-normal pairs and discover extraordinary variation in mutation frequency and spectrum within cancer types, which sheds light on mutational processes and disease aetiology, and in mutation frequency across the genome, which is strongly correlated with DNA replication timing and also with transcriptional activity. By incorporating mutational heterogeneity into the analyses, MutSigCV is able to eliminate most of the apparent artefactual findings and enable the identification of genes truly associated with cancer.},

To emphasize depth of knowledge on known cancer genes, mutation information is curated manually from the scientific literature, allowing very precise definitions of disease types and patient details. Combination of almost 20 000 published studies gives substantial resolution of how mutations and phenotypes relate in human cancer, providing insights into the stratification of mutations and biomarkers across cancer patient populations. Conversely, our curation of cancer genomes (over 12 000) emphasizes knowledge breadth, driving discovery of unrecognized cancer-driving hotspots and molecular targets. Our high-resolution curation approach is globally unique, giving substantial insight into molecular biomarkers in human oncology. In addition, COSMIC also details more than six million noncoding mutations, 10 534 gene fusions, 61 299 genome rearrangements, 695 504 abnormal copy number segments and 60 119 787 abnormal expression variants.

For most cancer types, this landscape consists of a small number of "mountains" (genes altered in a high percentage of tumors) and a much larger number of "hills" (genes altered infrequently). To date, these studies have revealed similar to 140 genes that, when altered by intragenic mutations, can promote or "drive" tumorigenesis. A typical tumor contains two to eight of these "driver gene" mutations; the remaining mutations are passengers that confer no selective growth advantage. Driver genes can be classified into 12 signaling pathways that regulate three core cellular processes: cell fate, cell survival, and genome maintenance. A better understanding of these pathways is one of the most pressing needs in basic cancer research. Even now, however, our knowledge of cancer genomes is sufficient to guide the development of more effective approaches for reducing cancer morbidity and mortality.},

Here we map somatic mutations in 505 tumor genomes across 14 cancer types and systematically screen for associations between mutations in regulatory regions and RNA-level changes. We identify recurrent promoter mutations in several genes but find that TERT mutations are exceptional in showing a strong and genome-wide significant association with increased expression. Detailed analysis of TERT across cancers shows that the strength of this association is highly variable and is strongest in copy number-stable cancers such as thyroid carcinoma. We additionally propose that TERT promoter mutations control expression of the nearby gene CLPTM1L. Our analysis provides a detailed pan-cancer view of TERT transcriptional activation but finds no clear evidence for frequent oncogenic promoter mutations beyond TERT.},

Here we distilled thousands of genetic and epigenetic features altered in cancers to ∼500 selected functional events (SFEs). Using this simplified description, we derived a hierarchical classification of 3,299 TCGA tumors from 12 cancer types. The top classes are dominated by either mutations (M class) or copy number changes (C class). This distinction is clearest at the extremes of genomic instability, indicating the presence of different oncogenic processes. The full hierarchy shows functional event patterns characteristic of multiple cross-tissue groups of tumors, termed oncogenic signature classes. Targetable functional events in a tumor class are suggestive of class-specific combination therapy.

abstract = {A recent slew of ENCyclopedia Of DNA Elements (ENCODE) Consortium publications, specifically the article signed by all Consortium members, put forward the idea that more than 80{\%} of the human genome is functional. This claim flies in the face of current estimates according to which the fraction of the genome that is evolutionarily conserved through purifying selection is less than 10{\%}. Thus, according to the ENCODE Consortium, a biological function can be maintained indefinitely without selection, which implies that at least 80 - 10 = 70{\%} of the genome is perfectly invulnerable to deleterious mutations, either because no mutation can ever occur in these "functional" regions or because no mutation in these regions can ever be deleterious. This absurd conclusion was reached through various means, chiefly by employing the seldom used "causal role" definition of biological function and then applying it inconsistently to different biochemical properties, by committing a logical fallacy known as "affirming the consequent," by failing to appreciate the crucial difference between "junk DNA" and "garbage DNA," by using analytical methods that yield biased errors and inflate estimates of functionality, by favoring statistical sensitivity over specificity, and by emphasizing statistical significance rather than the magnitude of the effect. Here, we detail the many logical and methodological transgressions involved in assigning functionality to almost every nucleotide in the human genome. The ENCODE results were predicted by one of its authors to necessitate the rewriting of textbooks. We agree, many textbooks dealing with marketing, mass-media hype, and public relations may well have to be rewritten.},

Given the large number of somatic mutations identified by such technologies, the prioritization of cancer-driving events is a consistent bottleneck. Most bioinformatics tools concentrate on driver mutations in the coding fraction of the genome, those causing changes in protein products. As more non-coding pathogenic variants are identified and characterized, the development of computational approaches to effectively prioritize cancer-driving variants within the non-coding fraction of human genome is becoming critical. After a short summary of methods for coding variant prioritization, we here review the highly diverse non-coding elements that may act as cancer drivers and describe recent methods that attempt to evaluate the deleteriousness of sequence variation in these elements. With such tools, the prioritization and identification of cancer-implicated regulatory elements and non-coding RNAs is becoming a reality.},

abstract = {Genomes of higher eukaryotes are mosaics of segments with various structural, functional, and evolutionary properties. The availability of whole-genome sequences allows the investigation of their structure as "texts" using different statistical and computational methods. One such method, referred to as Compositional Spectra (CS) analysis, is based on scoring the occurrences of fixed-length oligonucleotides (k-mers) in the target DNA sequence. CS analysis allows generating species- or region-specific characteristics of the genome, regardless of their length and the presence of coding DNA. In this study, we consider the heterogeneity of vertebrate genomes as a joint effect of regional variation in sequence organization superimposed on the differences in nucleotide composition. We estimated compositional and organizational heterogeneity of genome and chromosome sequences separately and found that both heterogeneity types vary widely among genomes as well as among chromosomes in all investigated taxonomic groups. The high correspondence of heterogeneity scores obtained on three genome fractions, coding, repetitive, and the remaining part of the noncoding DNA (the genome dark matter--GDM) allows the assumption that CS-heterogeneity may have functional relevance to genome regulation. Of special interest for such interpretation is the fact that natural GDM sequences display the highest deviation from the corresponding reshuffled sequences.},

Describing these regulatory elements and understanding how they evolve represent major challenges for biologists. Advances in the ability to survey genome-scale DNA sequence data are providing unprecedented opportunities to use evolutionary models and computational tools to identify functionally important elements and the mode of selection acting on them in multiple species. This chapter reviews some of the current methods that have been developed and applied on noncoding DNA, what they have shown us, and how they are limited. Results of several recent studies reveal that a significantly larger fraction of noncoding DNA in eukaryotic organisms is likely to be functional than previously believed, implying that the functional annotation of most noncoding DNA in these organisms is largely incomplete. In Drosophila, recent studies have further suggested that a large fraction of noncoding DNA divergence observed between species may be the product of recurrent adaptive substitution. Similar studies in humans have revealed a more complex pattern, with signatures of recurrent positive selection being largely concentrated in conserved noncoding DNA elements. Understanding these patterns and the extent to which they generalize to other organisms awaits the analysis of forthcoming genome-scale polymorphism and divergence data from more species.},

abstract = {In many biological scenarios, from the development of drug resistance in pathogens to the progression of healthy cells toward cancer, quantifying the selection acting on observed mutations is a central question. One difficulty in answering this question is the complexity of the background upon which mutations can arise, with multiple potential interactions between genetic loci. We here present a method for discerning selection from a population history that accounts for interference between mutations. Given sequences sampled from multiple time points in the history of a population, we infer selection at each locus by maximizing a likelihood function derived from a multilocus evolution model. We apply the method to the question of distinguishing between loci where new mutations are under positive selection (drivers) and loci that emit neutral mutations (passengers) in a Wright-Fisher model of evolution. Relative to an otherwise equivalent method in which the genetic background of mutations was ignored, our method inferred selection coefficients more accurately for both driver mutations evolving under clonal interference and passenger mutations reaching fixation in the population through genetic drift or hitchhiking. In a population history recorded by 750 sets of sequences of 100 individuals taken at intervals of 100 generations, a set of 50 loci were divided into drivers and passengers with a mean accuracy of {\textgreater}0.95 across a range of numbers of driver loci. The potential application of our model, either in full or in part, to a range of biological systems, is discussed.},

The hallmarks constitute an organizing principle for rationalizing the complexities of neoplastic disease. They include sustaining proliferative signaling, evading growth suppressors, resisting cell death, enabling replicative immortality, inducing angiogenesis, and activating invasion and metastasis. Underlying these hallmarks are genome instability, which generates the genetic diversity that expedites their acquisition, and inflammation, which fosters multiple hallmark functions. Conceptual progress in the last decade has added two emerging hallmarks of potential generality to this list-reprogramming of energy metabolism and evading immune destruction. In addition to cancer cells, tumors exhibit another dimension of complexity: they contain a repertoire of recruited, ostensibly normal cells that contribute to the acquisition of hallmark traits by creating the "tumor microenvironment." Recognition of the widespread applicability of these concepts will increasingly affect the development of new means to treat human cancer.},

abstract = {With the completion of the human genome sequence, attention turned to identifying and annotating its functional DNA elements. As a complement to genetic and comparative genomics approaches, the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements Project was launched to contribute maps of RNA transcripts, transcriptional regulator binding sites, and chromatin states in many cell types. The resulting genome-wide data reveal sites of biochemical activity with high positional resolution and cell type specificity that facilitate studies of gene regulation and interpretation of noncoding variants associated with human disease. However, the biochemically active regions cover a much larger fraction of the genome than do evolutionarily conserved regions, raising the question of whether nonconserved but biochemically active regions are truly functional. Here, we review the strengths and limitations of biochemical, evolutionary, and genetic approaches for defining functional DNA segments, potential sources for the observed differences in estimated genomic coverage, and the biological implications of these discrepancies. We also analyze the relationship between signal intensity, genomic coverage, and evolutionary conservation. Our results reinforce the principle that each approach provides complementary information and that we need to use combinations of all three to elucidate genome function in human biology and disease.},

abstract = {Cancer genome sequencing studies have identified cancer-driver genes from the increased accumulation of protein-altering mutations. However, the positional distributions of coding mutations, and the 79{\%} of somatic variants in exome data that do not alter protein sequence or RNA splicing, remain largely unstudied. We employed density-based clustering methods on {\~{}}4,700 exomes from 21 tumor types to detect variably-sized significantly mutated regions (SMRs). SMRs reveal recurrent alterations across a diverse spectrum of coding and non-coding elements, including microRNAs, transcription factor binding sites, and untranslated regions that are individually mutated in up to {\~{}}15{\%} of samples in specific cancer types. SMRs often associated with changes in gene expression and signaling. Mapping SMRs to protein structures revealed spatial clustering of somatic mutations at known and novel cancer-driver domains and molecular interfaces. Mutation frequencies in SMRs demonstrate that distinct protein regions are differentially mutated among tumor types. The functional diversity of SMRs underscores both the varied mechanisms of oncogenic misregulation and the advantage of unbiased driver identification.},

abstract = {The McDonald and Kreitman test (MKT) is one of the most powerful and extensively used tests to detect the signature of natural selection at the molecular level. Here, we present the standard and generalized MKT website, a novel website that allows performing MKTs not only for synonymous and nonsynonymous changes, as the test was initially described, but also for other classes of regions and/or several loci. The website has three different interfaces: (i) the standard MKT, where users can analyze several types of sites in a coding region, (ii) the advanced MKT, where users can compare two closely linked regions in the genome that can be either coding or noncoding, and (iii) the multi-locus MKT, where users can analyze many separate loci in a single multi-locus test. The website has already been used to show that selection efficiency is positively correlated with effective population size in the Drosophila genus and it has been applied to include estimates of selection in DPDB. This website is a timely resource, which will presumably be widely used by researchers in the field and will contribute to enlarge the catalogue of cases of adaptive evolution. It is available at http://mkt.uab.es.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To examine the possible effects of maternal and fetal characteristics on the fetal fraction in maternal plasma cell-free (cf) DNA at 11-13 weeks' gestation and estimate the proportion of pregnancies at high risk of non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) failure because the fetal fraction is less than 4{\%}.

METHODS: In 1949 singleton pregnancies at 11-13 weeks' gestation cf-DNA was extracted from maternal plasma. Chromosome-selective sequencing of non-polymorphic and polymorphic loci, where fetal alleles differ from maternal alleles, was used to determine the proportion of cf-DNA that was of fetal origin. Multivariable regression analysis was used to determine significant predictors of the fetal fraction among maternal and fetal characteristics.

RESULTS: The fetal fraction decreased with increased maternal weight, it was lower in women of Afro-Caribbean origin than in Caucasians and increased with fetal crown-rump length, serum pregnancy-associated plasma protein-A, serum free $\beta$-human chorionic gonadotropin, smoking and trisomy 21 karyotype. The median fetal fraction was 10.0{\%} (interquartile range, 7.8-13.0{\%}) and this decreased with maternal weight from 11.7{\%} at 60 kg to 3.9{\%} at 160 kg. The estimated proportion with fetal fraction below 4{\%} increased with maternal weight from 0.7{\%} at 60 kg to 7.1{\%} at 100 kg and 51.1{\%} at 160 kg.

CONCLUSIONS: Fetal fraction in maternal plasma cf-DNA is affected by maternal and fetal characteristics.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: We sought to develop a novel biochemical assay and algorithm for the prenatal evaluation of risk for fetal trisomy 21 (T21) and trisomy 18 (T18) using cell-free DNA obtained from maternal blood.

STUDY DESIGN: We assayed cell-free DNA from a training set and a blinded validation set of pregnant women, comprising 250 disomy, 72 T21, and 16 T18 pregnancies. We used digital analysis of selected regions in combination with a novel algorithm, fetal-fraction optimized risk of trisomy evaluation (FORTE), to determine trisomy risk for each subject.

RESULTS: In all, 163/171 subjects in the training set passed quality control criteria. Using a Z statistic, 35/35 T21 cases and 7/7 T18 cases had Z statistic {\textgreater}3 and 120/121 disomic cases had Z statistic {\textless}3. FORTE produced an individualized trisomy risk score for each subject, and correctly discriminated all T21 and T18 cases from disomic cases. All 167 subjects in the blinded validation set passed quality control and FORTE performance matched that observed in the training set correctly discriminating 36/36 T21 cases and 8/8 T18 cases from 123/123 disomic cases.

CONCLUSION: Digital analysis of selected regions and FORTE enable accurate, scalable noninvasive fetal aneuploidy detection.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq) has become the assay of choice for high-throughput studies of gene expression. However, as is the case with microarrays, major technology-related artifacts and biases affect the resulting expression measures. Normalization is therefore essential to ensure accurate inference of expression levels and subsequent analyses thereof.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: We focus on biases related to GC-content and demonstrate the existence of strong sample-specific GC-content effects on RNA-Seq read counts, which can substantially bias differential expression analysis. We propose three simple within-lane gene-level GC-content normalization approaches and assess their performance on two different RNA-Seq datasets, involving different species and experimental designs. Our methods are compared to state-of-the-art normalization procedures in terms of bias and mean squared error for expression fold-change estimation and in terms of Type I error and p-value distributions for tests of differential expression. The exploratory data analysis and normalization methods proposed in this article are implemented in the open-source Bioconductor R package EDASeq.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Our within-lane normalization procedures, followed by between-lane normalization, reduce GC-content bias and lead to more accurate estimates of expression fold-changes and tests of differential expression. Such results are crucial for the biological interpretation of RNA-Seq experiments, where downstream analyses can be sensitive to the supplied lists of genes.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To develop a new bioinformatic method in the noninvasive prenatal identification of common fetal aneuploidies using massively parallel sequencing on maternal plasma.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: Massively parallel sequencing was performed on plasma DNA samples from 108 pregnant women (median gestation: 12(+5) week) immediately before chorionic villus sampling (CVS) or amniocentesis. Data were analysed using a novel z-score method with internal reference chromosome. The diagnostic accuracies of the fetal karyotyping status were compared against two previously reported z-score methods--one without adjustment and the other with GC correction.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: A total of 32 cases with fetal aneuploidy were confirmed by conventional karyotyping, including 11 cases of Trisomy 21, 10 cases of Trisomy 18, 2 cases of Trisomy 13, 8 cases of Turner syndrome (45, XO) and one case of Klinefelter syndrome (47, XXY). Using the z-score method without reference adjustment, the detection rate for Trisomy 21, Trisomy 18, Trisomy 13, Turner syndrome, and Klinefelter's syndrome is 100{\%}, 40{\%}, 0{\%}, 88{\%} and 0{\%} respectively. Using the z-score method with GC correction, the detection rate increased to 100{\%} for Trisomy 21, 90{\%} for Trisomy 18, 100{\%} for Trisomy 13. By using the z-score method with internal reference, the detection rate increased to 100{\%} for all aneuploidies. The false positive rate was 0{\%} for all three methods.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: This massively parallel sequencing-based approach, combined with the improved z-score test methodology, enables the prenatal diagnosis of most common aneuploidies with a high degree of accuracy, even in the first trimester of pregnancy.},

This review seeks to highlight the necessity of investing in non invasive prenatal diagnosis (NIPD) and how NIPD would improve patient safety and detection rate as well as allowing detection earlier in pregnancy. Non invasive prenatal diagnosis can take either a proteomics approach or nucleic acid-based approach; this review focuses on the latter. Since the discovery of cell free fetal DNA (cffDNA) and fetal RNA in maternal plasma, procedures have been developed for detection for monogenic traits and for some have become well established (e.g., RHD blood group status). However, NIPD of aneuploidies remains technically challenging. This review examines currently published literature evaluating techniques and approaches that have been suggested and developed for aneuploidy detection, highlighting their advantages and limitations and areas for further research.},

Summary
Antenatal diagnosis of fetal abnormalities is based on ultrasound scan and biochemical markers. In France, first studies began in 1990 leading to a national screening of Down syndrome in 1997 combining maternal age and biochemical markers in second-trimester (at 14-18 weeks gestation) This legislation has just been modified in 2009 to allow first-trimester screening (at 11- 13 weeks gestation) by adding fetal nuchal translucency to risk calculation in order to reduce amniocentesis. Final risk select pregnant women at increased risk of Down syndrome. Nevertheless, the profile of markers must be looked in an attentive way to detect other fetal or maternal pathology. This new screening of 2009 allows to detect Down syndrome but also other chromosomic abnormalities (as trisomy 13, trisomy 18 or triploidy), or non-chromosomic abnormalities as In Utero Fetal Death, neural tube defects or congenital abdominal wall defects. Maternal pathologies can also be detected and treated accordingly (mole, pre eclampsia, gravidic toxaemia, HELLP syndrome).},

Summary
Trisomy 21 (Down syndrome, DS) is the most frequent among aneuploidies. For many years the only risk factors were maternal age and severe fetal malformations detected at ultrasound scan. Later, it has been shown that abnormally high values of human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) and abnormally low alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) are associated to an increase in Down syndrome risk. Then, maternal serum marker screening was proposed to all pregnant women in order to evaluate an individual risk of DS. The DS risk is calculated using a specific software taking into account maternal age, hCG and AFP concentrations expressed in multiple of the median, and various maternal parameters such as maternal weight and smoking status. In France prenatal diagnosis is strickly regulated (27 january 1997) and 75 laboratories are accredited. This prenatal screening gives a 73{\%} detection rate for a 7{\%} false positive rate.

There is now a need to improve this screening in order to reduce amniocentesis rate. So the combination of the ultrasound (nuchal translucency) and biochemical markers (of the first trimester such as pregnancy associated plasma protein and free beta-hCG, or those of the second trimester) is the present challenge.},

abstract = {GC content bias describes the dependence between fragment count (read coverage) and GC content found in Illumina sequencing data. This bias can dominate the signal of interest for analyses that focus on measuring fragment abundance within a genome, such as copy number estimation (DNA-seq). The bias is not consistent between samples; and there is no consensus as to the best methods to remove it in a single sample. We analyze regularities in the GC bias patterns, and find a compact description for this unimodal curve family. It is the GC content of the full DNA fragment, not only the sequenced read, that most influences fragment count. This GC effect is unimodal: both GC-rich fragments and AT-rich fragments are underrepresented in the sequencing results. This empirical evidence strengthens the hypothesis that PCR is the most important cause of the GC bias. We propose a model that produces predictions at the base pair level, allowing strand-specific GC-effect correction regardless of the downstream smoothing or binning. These GC modeling considerations can inform other high-throughput sequencing analyses such as ChIP-seq and RNA-seq.},

abstract = {Chromosomal aneuploidy is the major reason why couples opt for prenatal diagnosis. Current methods for definitive diagnosis rely on invasive procedures, such as chorionic villus sampling and amniocentesis, and are associated with a risk of fetal miscarriage. Fetal DNA has been found in maternal plasma but exists as a minor fraction among a high background of maternal DNA. Hence, quantitative perturbations caused by an aneuploid chromosome in the fetal genome to the overall representation of sequences from that chromosome in maternal plasma would be small. Even with highly precise single molecule counting methods such as digital PCR, a large number of DNA molecules and hence maternal plasma volume would need to be analyzed to achieve the necessary analytical precision. Here we reasoned that instead of using approaches that target specific gene loci, the use of a locus-independent method would greatly increase the number of target molecules from the aneuploid chromosome that could be analyzed within the same fixed volume of plasma. Hence, we used massively parallel genomic sequencing to quantify maternal plasma DNA sequences for the noninvasive prenatal detection of fetal trisomy 21. Twenty-eight first and second trimester maternal plasma samples were tested. All 14 trisomy 21 fetuses and 14 euploid fetuses were correctly identified. Massively parallel plasma DNA sequencing represents a new approach that is potentially applicable to all pregnancies for the noninvasive prenatal diagnosis of fetal chromosomal aneuploidies.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Noninvasive prenatal testing based on massively parallel sequencing (MPS) of cell-free DNA in maternal plasma has become rapidly integrated into clinical practice for detecting fetal chromosomal aneuploidy. We directly determined the fetal fraction (FF) from results obtained with MPS tag counting and examined the relationships of FF to such biological parameters as fetal karyotype and maternal demographics. METHODS: FF was determined from samples previously collected for the MELISSA (Maternal Blood Is Source to Accurately Diagnose Fetal Aneuploidy) study. Samples were resequenced, analyzed blindly, and aligned to the human genome (assembly hg19). FF was calculated in pregnancies with male or aneuploid fetuses by means of an equation that incorporated the ratio of the tags in these samples to those of a euploid training set. RESULTS: The mean (SD) FF from euploid male pregnancies was 0.126 (0.052) (n = 160). Weak but statistically significant correlations were found between FF and the maternal body mass index (r(2) = 0.18; P = 2.3 × 10(-8)) and between FF and gestational age (r(2) = 0.02; P = 0.047). No relationship with maternal ethnicity or age was observed. Mean FF values for trisomies 21 (n = 90), 18 (n = 38), and 13 (n = 16) and for monosomy X (n = 20) were 0.135 (0.051), 0.089 (0.039), 0.090 (0.062), and 0.106 (0.045), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: MPS tag-count data can be used to determine FF directly and accurately. Compared with male euploid fetuses, the FF is higher in maternal plasma when the fetus has trisomy 21 and is lower when the fetus has trisomy 18, 13, or monosomy X. The different biologies of these aneuploidies have practical implications for the determination of cutoff values, which in turn will affect the diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of the test.},

abstract = {Using a highly sensitive allele-specific PCR amplification method, we have previously shown that maternal cells could be detected in all 10 cord bloods tested. This raised the question of whether maternal cells are released into cord blood during the process of delivery or whether they are already present during pregnancy. We have now used the same PCR method to detect the presence of maternal cells in nine fetal blood samples collected at different gestational ages. Maternal cells were detected in eight samples obtained between 24 and 35 weeks of gestation. They were estimated to amount between 10(-4) and 10(-5) of nucleated fetal blood cells. In two cases mononuclear and polymorphonuclear cell fractions were separated by Ficoll gradient centrifugation and maternal cells were detected as comparable levels in both fractions. Maternal cells could not be detected in the one fetal blood sample obtained at 20 weeks of gestation, suggesting that maternal cells could appear at detectable levels in fetal blood during the third trimester of pregnancy. These results are discussed in terms of materno-fetal immune tolerance and of transmission of viruses (and more specifically of the human immunodeficiency virus) from mother to child.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Eugene Myers in his string graph paper suggested that in a string graph or equivalently a unitig graph, any path spells a valid assembly. As a string/unitig graph also encodes every valid assembly of reads, such a graph, provided that it can be constructed correctly, is in fact a lossless representation of reads. In principle, every analysis based on whole-genome shotgun sequencing (WGS) data, such as SNP and insertion/deletion (INDEL) calling, can also be achieved with unitigs.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: To explore the feasibility of using de novo assembly in the context of resequencing, we developed a de novo assembler, fermi, that assembles Illumina short reads into unitigs while preserving most of information of the input reads. SNPs and INDELs can be called by mapping the unitigs against a reference genome. By applying the method on 35-fold human resequencing data, we showed that in comparison to the standard pipeline, our approach yields similar accuracy for SNP calling and better results for INDEL calling. It has higher sensitivity than other de novo assembly based methods for variant calling. Our work suggests that variant calling with de novo assembly can be a beneficial complement to the standard variant calling pipeline for whole-genome resequencing.

abstract = {MOTIVATION: High-throughput sequencing technologies place ever increasing demands on existing algorithms for sequence analysis. Algorithms for computing maximal exact matches (MEMs) between sequences appear in two contexts where high-throughput sequencing will vastly increase the volume of sequence data: (i) seeding alignments of high-throughput reads for genome assembly and (ii) designating anchor points for genome-genome comparisons.

RESULTS: We introduce a new algorithm for finding MEMs. The algorithm leverages a sparse suffix array (SA), a text index that stores every K-th position of the text. In contrast to a full text index that stores every position of the text, a sparse SA occupies much less memory. Even though we use a sparse index, the output of our algorithm is the same as a full text index algorithm as long as the space between the indexed suffixes is not greater than a minimum length of a MEM. By relying on partial matches and additional text scanning between indexed positions, the algorithm trades memory for extra computation. The reduced memory usage makes it possible to determine MEMs between significantly longer sequences.

AVAILABILITY: Source code for the algorithm is available under a BSD open source license at http://compbio.cs.princeton.edu/mems. The implementation can serve as a drop-in replacement for the MEMs algorithm in MUMmer 3.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The potential use of plasma and serum for molecular diagnosis has generated interest. Tumour DNA has been found in 'the plasma and serum of cancer patients, and molecular analysis has been done on this material. We investigated the equivalent condition in pregnancy-that is, whether fetal DNA is present in maternal plasma and serum.

METHODS: We used a rapid-boiling method to extract DNA from plasma and serum. DNA from plasma, serum, and nucleated blood cells from 43 pregnant women underwent a sensitive Y-PCR assay to detect circulating male fetal DNA from women bearing male fetuses.

FINDINGS: Fetus-derived Y sequences were detected in 24 (80{\%}) of the 30 maternal plasma samples, and in 21 (70{\%}) of the 30 maternal serum samples, from women bearing male fetuses. These results were obtained with only 10 microL of the samples. When DNA from nucleated blood cells extracted from a similar volume of blood was used, only five (17{\%}) of the 30 samples gave a positive Y signal. None of the 13 women bearing female fetuses, and none of the ten non-pregnant control women, had positive results for plasma, serum or nucleated blood cells.

INTERPRETATION: Our finding of circulating fetal DNA in maternal plasma may have implications for non-invasive prenatal diagnosis, and for improving our understanding of the fetomaternal relationship.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To assess the feasibility of applying a high throughput method, with an automated robotic technique, for predicting fetal RhD phenotype from fetal DNA in the plasma of RhD negative pregnant women to avoid unnecessary treatment with anti-RhD immunoglobulin. DESIGN: Prospective comparison of fetal RHD genotype determined from fetal DNA in maternal plasma with the serologically determined fetal RhD phenotype from cord blood. SETTING: Antenatal clinics and antenatal testing laboratories in the Midlands and north of England and an international blood group reference laboratory. PARTICIPANTS: Pregnant women of known gestation identified as RhD negative by an antenatal testing laboratory. Samples from 1997 women were taken at or before the 28 week antenatal visit. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Detection rate of fetal RhD from maternal plasma, error rate, false positive rate, and the odds of being affected given a positive result. RESULTS: Serologically determined RhD phenotypes were obtained from 1869 cord blood samples. In 95.7{\%} (n=1788) the correct fetal RhD phenotype was predicted by the genotyping tests. In 3.4{\%} (n=64) results were either unobtainable or inconclusive. A false positive result was obtained in 0.8{\%} (14 samples), probably because of unexpressed or weakly expressed fetal RHD genes. In only three samples (0.2{\%}) were false negative results obtained. If these results had been applied as a guide to treatment, only 2{\%} of the women would have received anti-RhD unnecessarily, compared with 38{\%} without the genotyping. CONCLUSIONS: High throughput RHD genotyping of fetuses in all RhD negative women is feasible and would substantially reduce unnecessary administration of anti-RhD immunoglobulin to RhD negative pregnant women with an RhD negative fetus.},

abstract = {CONTEXT: Noninvasive prenatal determination of fetal sex using cell-free fetal DNA provides an alternative to invasive techniques for some heritable disorders. In some countries this testing has transitioned to clinical care, despite the absence of a formal assessment of performance.

OBJECTIVE: To document overall test performance of noninvasive fetal sex determination using cell-free fetal DNA and to identify variables that affect performance.

DATA SOURCES: Systematic review and meta-analysis with search of PubMed (January 1, 1997-April 17, 2011) to identify English-language human studies reporting primary data. References from review articles were also searched.

STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: Abstracts were read independently to identify studies reporting primary data suitable for analysis. Covariates included publication year, sample type, DNA amplification methodology, Y chromosome sequence, and gestational age. Data were independently extracted by 2 reviewers.

RESULTS: From 57 selected studies, 80 data sets (representing 3524 male-bearing pregnancies and 3017 female-bearing pregnancies) were analyzed. Overall performance of the test to detect Y chromosome sequences had the following characteristics: sensitivity, 95.4{\%} (95{\%} confidence interval [CI], 94.7{\%}-96.1{\%}) and specificity, 98.6{\%} (95{\%} CI, 98.1{\%}-99.0{\%}); diagnostic odds ratio (OR), 885; positive predictive value, 98.8{\%}; negative predictive value, 94.8{\%}; area under curve (AUC), 0.993 (95{\%} CI, 0.989-0.995), with significant interstudy heterogeneity. DNA methodology and gestational age had the largest effects on test performance. Methodology test characteristics were AUC, 0.988 (95{\%} CI, 0.979-0.993) for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and AUC, 0.996 (95{\%} CI, 0.993-0.998) for real-time quantitative PCR (RTQ-PCR) (P = .02). Gestational age test characteristics were AUC, 0.989 (95{\%} CI, 0.965-0.998) ({\textless}7 weeks); AUC, 0.994 (95{\%} CI, 0.987-0.997) (7-12 weeks); AUC, 0.992 (95{\%} CI, 0.983-0.996) (13-20 weeks); and AUC, 0.998 (95{\%} CI, 0.990-0.999) ({\textgreater}20 weeks) (P = .02 for comparison of diagnostic ORs across age ranges). RTQ-PCR (sensitivity, 96.0{\%}; specificity, 99.0{\%}) outperformed conventional PCR (sensitivity, 94.0{\%}; specificity, 97.3{\%}). Testing after 20 weeks (sensitivity, 99.0{\%}; specificity, 99.6{\%}) outperformed testing prior to 7 weeks (sensitivity, 74.5{\%}; specificity, 99.1{\%}), testing at 7 through 12 weeks (sensitivity, 94.8{\%}; specificity, 98.9{\%}), and 13 through 20 weeks (sensitivity, 95.5{\%}; specificity, 99.1{\%}).

CONCLUSIONS: Despite interstudy variability, performance was high using maternal blood. Sensitivity and specificity for detection of Y chromosome sequences was greatest using RTQ-PCR after 20 weeks' gestation. Tests using urine and tests performed before 7 weeks' gestation were unreliable.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Plasma DNA obtained from a pregnant woman contains a mixture of maternal and fetal DNA. The fetal DNA proportion in maternal plasma is relatively consistent as determined using polymorphic genetic markers across different chromosomes in euploid pregnancies. For aneuploid pregnancies, the observed fetal DNA proportion measured using polymorphic genetic markers for the aneuploid chromosome would be perturbed. In this study, we investigated the feasibility of analyzing single nucleotide polymorphisms using targeted massively parallel sequencing to detect such perturbations in mothers carrying trisomy 21 fetuses.

METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: DNA was extracted from plasma samples collected from fourteen pregnant women carrying singleton fetuses. Hybridization-based targeted sequencing was used to enrich 2 906 single nucleotide polymorphism loci on chr7, chr13, chr18 and chr21. Plasma DNA libraries with and without target enrichment were analyzed by massively parallel sequencing. Genomic DNA samples of both the mother and fetus for each case were genotyped by single nucleotide polymorphism microarray analysis. For the targeted regions, the mean sequencing depth of the enriched samples was 225-fold higher than that of the non-enriched samples. From the targeted sequencing data, the ratio between fetus-specific and shared alleles increased by approximately 2-fold on chr21 in the paternally-derived trisomy 21 case. In comparison, the ratio is decreased by approximately 11{\%} on chr21 in the maternally-derived trisomy 21 cases but with much overlap with the ratio of the euploid cases. Computer simulation revealed the relationship between the fetal DNA proportion, the number of informative alleles and the depth of sequencing.

CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Targeted massively parallel sequencing of single nucleotide polymorphism loci in maternal plasma DNA is a potential approach for trisomy 21 detection. However, the method appears to be less robust than approaches using non-polymorphism-based counting of sequence tags in plasma.},

abstract = {Chromosomal aneuploidy is the major reason why couples opt for prenatal diagnosis. Current methods for definitive diagnosis rely on invasive procedures, such as chorionic villus sampling and amniocentesis, and are associated with a risk of fetal miscarriage. Fetal DNA has been found in maternal plasma but exists as a minor fraction among a high background of maternal DNA. Hence, quantitative perturbations caused by an aneuploid chromosome in the fetal genome to the overall representation of sequences from that chromosome in maternal plasma would be small. Even with highly precise single molecule counting methods such as digital PCR, a large number of DNA molecules and hence maternal plasma volume would need to be analyzed to achieve the necessary analytical precision. Here we reasoned that instead of using approaches that target specific gene loci, the use of a locus-independent method would greatly increase the number of target molecules from the aneuploid chromosome that could be analyzed within the same fixed volume of plasma. Hence, we used massively parallel genomic sequencing to quantify maternal plasma DNA sequences for the noninvasive prenatal detection of fetal trisomy 21. Twenty-eight first and second trimester maternal plasma samples were tested. All 14 trisomy 21 fetuses and 14 euploid fetuses were correctly identified. Massively parallel plasma DNA sequencing represents a new approach that is potentially applicable to all pregnancies for the noninvasive prenatal diagnosis of fetal chromosomal aneuploidies.},

@article{Srinivasan2013,
abstract = {The purpose of this study was to determine the deep sequencing and analytic conditions needed to detect fetal subchromosome abnormalities across the genome from a maternal blood sample. Cell-free (cf) DNA was isolated from the plasma of 11 pregnant women carrying fetuses with subchromosomal duplications and deletions, translocations, mosaicism, and trisomy 20 diagnosed by metaphase karyotype. Massively parallel sequencing (MPS) was performed with 25-mer tags at approximately 10(9) tags per sample and mapped to reference human genome assembly hg19. Tags were counted and normalized to fixed genome bin sizes of 1 Mb or 100 kb to detect statistically distinct copy-number changes compared to the reference. All seven cases of microdeletions, duplications, translocations, and the trisomy 20 were detected blindly by MPS, including a microdeletion as small as 300 kb. In two of these cases in which the metaphase karyotype showed additional material of unknown origin, MPS identified both the translocation breakpoint and the chromosomal origin of the additional material. In the four mosaic cases, the subchromosomal abnormality was not demonstrated by MPS. This work shows that in nonmosaic cases, it is possible to obtain a fetal molecular karyotype by MPS of maternal plasma cfDNA that is equivalent to a chromosome microarray and in some cases is better than a metaphase karyotype. This approach combines the advantage of enhanced fetal genomic resolution with the improved safety of a noninvasive maternal blood test.},

@article{Benjamini2012,
abstract = {GC content bias describes the dependence between fragment count (read coverage) and GC content found in Illumina sequencing data. This bias can dominate the signal of interest for analyses that focus on measuring fragment abundance within a genome, such as copy number estimation (DNA-seq). The bias is not consistent between samples; and there is no consensus as to the best methods to remove it in a single sample. We analyze regularities in the GC bias patterns, and find a compact description for this unimodal curve family. It is the GC content of the full DNA fragment, not only the sequenced read, that most influences fragment count. This GC effect is unimodal: both GC-rich fragments and AT-rich fragments are underrepresented in the sequencing results. This empirical evidence strengthens the hypothesis that PCR is the most important cause of the GC bias. We propose a model that produces predictions at the base pair level, allowing strand-specific GC-effect correction regardless of the downstream smoothing or binning. These GC modeling considerations can inform other high-throughput sequencing analyses such as ChIP-seq and RNA-seq.},

@article{Fan2010,
abstract = {We recently demonstrated noninvasive detection of fetal aneuploidy by shotgun sequencing cell-free DNA in maternal plasma using next-generation high throughput sequencer. However, GC bias introduced by the sequencer placed a practical limit on the sensitivity of aneuploidy detection. In this study, we describe a method to computationally remove GC bias in short read sequencing data by applying weight to each sequenced read based on local genomic GC content. We show that sensitivity is limited only by counting statistics and that sensitivity can be increased to arbitrary precision in sample containing arbitrarily small fraction of fetal DNA simply by sequencing more DNA molecules. High throughput shotgun sequencing of maternal plasma DNA should therefore enable noninvasive diagnosis of any type of fetal aneuploidy.},

@article{Straver2014,
abstract = {Genetic disorders can be detected by prenatal diagnosis using Chorionic Villus Sampling, but the 1:100 chance to result in miscarriage restricts the use to fetuses that are suspected to have an aberration. Detection of trisomy 21 cases noninvasively is now possible owing to the upswing of next-generation sequencing (NGS) because a small percentage of fetal DNA is present in maternal plasma. However, detecting other trisomies and smaller aberrations can only be realized using high-coverage NGS, making it too expensive for routine practice. We present a method, WISECONDOR (WIthin-SamplE COpy Number aberration DetectOR), which detects small aberrations using low-coverage NGS. The increased detection resolution was achieved by comparing read counts within the tested sample of each genomic region with regions on other chromosomes that behave similarly in control samples. This within-sample comparison avoids the need to re-sequence control samples. WISECONDOR correctly identified all T13, T18 and T21 cases while coverages were as low as 0.15-1.66. No false positives were identified. Moreover, WISECONDOR also identified smaller aberrations, down to 20 Mb, such as del(13)(q12.3q14.3), +i(12)(p10) and i(18)(q10). This shows that prevalent fetal copy number aberrations can be detected accurately and affordably by shallow sequencing maternal plasma. WISECONDOR is available at bioinformatics.tudelft.nl/wisecondor.},
