abstract = {Investigation of the lung microbiome is a relatively new field. Although the lungs were classically believed to be sterile, recently published investigations have identified microbial communities in the lungs of healthy humans. At the present time, there are significant methodologic and technical hurdles that must be addressed in ongoing investigations, including distinguishing the microbiota of the upper and lower respiratory tracts. However, characterization of the lung microbiome is likely to provide important pathogenic insights into cystic fibrosis, respiratory disease of the newborn, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and asthma. In addition to characterization of the lung microbiome, the microbiota of the gastrointestinal tract have profound influence on development and maintenance of lung immunity and inflammation. Further study of gastrointestinal-respiratory interactions are likely to yield important insights into the pathogenesis of pulmonary diseases, including asthma. As this field advances over the next several years, we anticipate that studies utilizing larger cohorts, multi-center designs, and longitudinal sampling will add to our knowledge and understanding of the lung microbiome.},

abstract = {The opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa causes a variety of infections in immunocompromised individuals, including individuals with the heritable disease cystic fibrosis. Like the carbon sources metabolized by many disease-causing bacteria, the carbon sources metabolized by P. aeruginosa at the host infection site are unknown. We recently reported that l-alanine is a preferred carbon source for P. aeruginosa and that two genes potentially involved in alanine catabolism (dadA and dadX) are induced during in vivo growth in the rat peritoneum and during in vitro growth in sputum (mucus) collected from the lungs of individuals with cystic fibrosis. The goals of this study were to characterize factors required for alanine catabolism in P. aeruginosa and to assess the importance of these factors for in vivo growth. Our results reveal that dadA and dadX are arranged in an operon and are required for catabolism of l-alanine. The dad operon is inducible by l-alanine, d-alanine, and l-valine, and induction is dependent on the transcriptional regulator Lrp. Finally, we show that a mutant unable to catabolize dl-alanine displays decreased competitiveness in a rat lung model of infection.},

abstract = {| Each individual harbours a unique set of commensal microorganisms, collectively referred to as the microbiota. Notably, these microorganisms exceed the number of cells in the human body by 10-fold. This finding has accelerated a shift in our understanding of human physiology, with the realization that traits necessary for health are both encoded and influenced by the human genome and the microbiota. Our understanding of the aetiology of complex diseases has, therefore, evolved with increasing awareness that the human microbiota has an active and critical role in maintaining health and inducing disease. Indeed, findings from bioinformatic studies indicate that the microbiota and microbiome have multiple effects on the innate and adaptive immune systems, with effects on infection, autoimmune disease and cancer. In this Review, we first address the important statistical and informatics aspects that should be considered when characterizing the composition of microbiota. We next highlight the effects of the microbiota on the immune system and the implications of these effects on organ failure and transplantation. Finally, we reflect on the future perspectives for studies of the microbiota, including novel diagnostic tests and therapeutics.},

abstract = {Background: Given the polymicrobial nature of pulmonary infections in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF), it is essential to enhance our knowledge on the composition of the microbial community to improve patient management. In this study, we developed a pyrosequencing approach to extensively explore the diversity and dynamics of fungal and prokaryotic populations in CF lower airways. Methodology and Principal Findings: Fungi and bacteria diversity in eight sputum samples collected from four adult CF patients was investigated using conventional microbiological culturing and high-throughput pyrosequencing approach targeting the ITS2 locus and the 16S rDNA gene. The unveiled microbial community structure was compared to the clinical profile of the CF patients. Pyrosequencing confirmed recently reported bacterial diversity and observed complex fungal communities, in which more than 60{\%} of the species or genera were not detected by cultures. Strikingly, the diversity and species richness of fungal and bacterial communities was significantly lower in patients with decreased lung function and poor clinical status. Values of Chao1 richness estimator were statistically correlated with values of the Shwachman-Kulczycki score, body mass index, forced vital capacity, and forced expiratory volume in 1 s (p = 0.046, 0.047, 0.004, and 0.001, respectively for fungal Chao1 indices, and p = 0.010, 0.047, 0.002, and 0.0003, respectively for bacterial Chao1 values). Phylogenetic analysis showed high molecular diversities at the sub-species level for the main fungal and bacterial taxa identified in the present study. Anaerobes were isolated with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which was more likely to be observed in association with Candida albicans than with Aspergillus fumigatus. Conclusions: In light of the recent concept of CF lung microbiota, we viewed the microbial community as a unique pathogenic entity. We thus interpreted our results to highlight the potential interactions between microorganisms and the role of fungi in the context of improving survival in CF.},

abstract = {Culture-independent microbiological techniques have shown a previously unappreciated complexity to the bacterial microbiome of the respiratory tract that forces reconsideration of the interactions between host, bacteria, and the pathogenesis of exacerbations of chronic lung disease. The composition of the lung microbiome is determined by microbial immigration, elimination, and relative growth rates of its members. All these factors change dramatically in chronic lung disease and further during exacerbations. Exacerbations lack the features of bacterial infections, including increased bacterial burden and decreased diversity of microbial communities. We propose that exacerbations are occasions of respiratory tract dysbiosis--a disorder of the respiratory tract microbial ecosystem with negative effects on host biology. Respiratory tract dysbiosis provokes a dysregulated host immune response, which in turn alters growth conditions for microbes in airways, promoting further dysbiosis and perpetuating a cycle of inflammation and disordered microbiota. Differences in the composition of baseline respiratory tract microbiota might help to explain the so-called frequent-exacerbator phenotype observed in several disease states, and might provide novel targets for therapeutic intervention.},

abstract = {Bacterial diversity among environmental samples is commonly assessed with PCR-amplified 16S rRNA gene (16S) se-quences. Perceived diversity, however, can be influenced by sample preparation, primer selection, and formation of chimeric 16S amplification products. Chimeras are hybrid products between multiple parent sequences that can be falsely interpreted as novel organisms, thus inflating apparent diversity. We developed a new chimera detection tool called Chimera Slayer (CS). CS detects chimeras with greater sensitivity than previous methods, performs well on short se-quences such as those produced by the 454 Life Sciences (Roche) Genome Sequencer, and can scale to large data sets. By benchmarking CS performance against sequences derived from a controlled DNA mixture of known organisms and a simulated chimera set, we provide insights into the factors that affect chimera formation such as sequence abundance, the extent of similarity between 16S genes, and PCR conditions. Chimeras were found to reproducibly form among independent amplifications and contributed to false perceptions of sample diversity and the false identification of novel taxa, with less-abundant species exhibiting chimera rates exceeding 70{\%}. Shotgun metagenomic sequences of our mock community appear to be devoid of 16S chimeras, supporting a role for shotgun metagenomics in validating novel or-ganisms discovered in targeted sequence surveys. [Supplemental material is available for this article. The sequence data from this study have been submitted to the NCBI Entrez Genome Project database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomeprj) under ID nos. 48465, 48471, 53501, and 60767. Software tools and data sets are freely available at http://microbiomeutil.sourceforge.net.] The analysis of 16S rRNA (16S) genes has become an essential component of the microbial ecologist's tool kit to evaluate the microbial composition of diverse habitats such as soils, oceans, and our own bodies. The high-sequence conservation of 16S genes among diverse bacteria allows for the phylogenetic analysis of or-ganism diversity and the identification of new taxa. The majority of bacterial phyla are known only from 16S surveys and have no cultured representatives (Rappe and Giovannoni 2003; Wu et al. 2009). Several online resources host large, curated collections of 16S sequences, including GreenGenes (DeSantis et al. 2006a), the Ribosomal Database Project (RDP) (Cole et al. 2009), SILVA (Pruesse et al. 2007), and EZ-Taxon (Chun et al. 2007). Despite efforts by the curators to remove low-quality sequences from survey data, it is likely that many of these reference sequences reflect sequencing artifacts rather than real biological diversity.},

Specific sites in the respiratory tract contain specialized bacterial communities that are thought to have a major role in the maintenance of human health. In the past decade, next‑generation sequencing has led to major advances in our understanding of the possible functions of the resident microbiota. So far, research has largely focused on the gut microbiota and gut microbiota‑derived metab‑ olites, and their influence on host metabolism and immu‑ nity. However, recent studies on microbial ecosystems at other body sites, including the respiratory tract, reveal an even broader role for the microbiota in human health 1 . The respiratory tract is a complex organ system that is divided into the upper respiratory tract (URT) and the lower respiratory tract (LRT). The URT includes the anterior nares, nasal passages, paranasal sinuses, the naso‑ pharynx and oropharynx, and the portion of the larynx above the vocal cords, whereas the LRT includes the portion of the larynx below the vocal cords, the trachea, smaller airways (that is, bronchi and bronchioli) and alveoli. The primary function of the respiratory tract in human physiology is the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide. For this purpose, the adult human airways have a surface area of approximately 70 m 2},

abstract = {Background: The lung of patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) is particularly sensitive to Pseudomonas aeruginosa. This bacterium plays an important role in the poor outcome of CF patients. During the disease progress, first acquisition of P. aeruginosa is the key-step in the management of CF patients. Quantitative PCR (qPCR) offers an opportunity to detect earlier the first acquisition of P. aeruginosa by CF patients. Given the lack of a validated protocol, our goal was to find an optimal molecular protocol for detection of P. aeruginosa in CF patients. Methods: We compared two formerly described qPCR formats in early detection of P. aeruginosa in CF sputum samples: a qPCR targeting oprL gene, and a multiplex PCR targeting gyrB and ecfX genes. Results: Tested in vitro on a large panel of P. aeruginosa isolates and others gram-negative bacilli, oprL qPCR exhibited a better sensitivity (threshold of 10 CFU/mL versus 730 CFU/mL), whereas the gyrB/ecfX qPCR exhibited a better specificity (90{\%} versus 73{\%}). These results were validated ex vivo on 46 CF sputum samples positive for P. aeruginosa in culture. Ex vivo assays revealed that qPCR detected 100 times more bacterial cells than culture-based method did. Conclusion: Based on these results, we proposed a reference molecular protocol combining the two qPCRs, which offers a sensitivity of 100{\%} with a threshold of 10 CFU/mL and a specificity of 100{\%}. This combined qPCR-based protocol can be adapted and used for other future prospective studies.},

abstract = {The major therapeutic strategy used to treat exacerbated cystic fibrosis (CF) is antibiotic treatment. As this approach easily generates antibiotic-resistant strains of opportunistic bacteria, optimized antibiotic therapies are required to effectively control chronic and recurrent bacterial infections in CF patients. A promising future for the proper use of antibiotics is the management of lung microbiota. However, the impact of antibiotic treatments on CF microbiota and vice versa is not fully understood. This study analyzed 718 sputum samples from 18 previous studies to identify differences between CF and uninfected lung microbiota and to evaluate the effects of antibiotic treatments on exacerbated CF microbiota. A reference-based OTU (operational taxonomic unit) picking method was used to combine analyses of data generated using different protocols and platforms. Findings show that CF microbiota had greater richness and lower diversity in the community structure than uninfected control (NIC) microbiota. Specifically, CF microbiota showed higher levels of opportunistic bacteria and dramatically lower levels of commensal bacteria. Antibiotic treatment affected exacerbated CF microbiota notably but only transiently during the treatment period. Limited decrease of the dominant opportunistic bacteria and a dramatic decrease of commensal bacteria were observed during the antibiotic treatment for CF exacerbation. Simultaneously, low abundance opportunistic bacteria were thriving after the antibiotic treatment. The inefficiency of the current antibiotic treatment against major opportunistic bacteria and the detrimental effects on commensal bacteria indicate that the current empiric antibiotic treatment on CF exacerbation should be reevaluated and optimized.},

abstract = {As DNA sequencing becomes faster and cheaper, genomics-based approaches are being explored for their use in personalized diagnoses and treatments. Here, we provide a proof of principle for disease monitoring using personal metagenomic sequencing and traditional clinical microbiology by focusing on three adults with cystic fibrosis (CF). The CF lung is a dynamic environment that hosts a complex ecosystem composed of bacteria, viruses, and fungi that can vary in space and time. Not surprisingly, the microbiome data from the induced sputum samples we collected revealed a significant amount of species diversity not seen in routine clinical laboratory cultures. The relative abundances of several species changed as clinical treatment was altered, enabling the identification of the climax and attack communities that were proposed in an earlier work. All patient microbiomes encoded a diversity of mechanisms to resist antibiotics, consistent with the characteristics of multidrug-resistant microbial communities that are commonly observed in CF patients. The metabolic potentials of these communities differed by the health status and recovery route of each patient. Thus, this pilot study provides an example of how metagenomic data might be used with clinical assessments for the development of treatments tailored to individual patients.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION
La primo-d{\'{e}}tection de Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) dans les s{\'{e}}cr{\'{e}}tions respiratoires des enfants atteints de mucoviscidose marque un tournant dans l'histoire de la maladie. L'origine de cette acquisition reste controvers{\'{e}}e. L'objectif de cette {\'{e}}tude est d'identifier des facteurs environnementaux influen{\c{c}}ant la primo-d{\'{e}}tection pr{\'{e}}coce {\`{a}} PA durant les deux premi{\`{e}}res ann{\'{e}}es de vie chez les enfants atteint de mucoviscidose. 

M{\'{E}}THODES
Nous avons r{\'{e}}alis{\'{e}} une {\'{e}}tude de cohorte r{\'{e}}trospective monocentrique chez 129 patients ag{\'{e}}s de 2 {\`{a}} 22ans suivis au CRCM p{\'{e}}diatrique du CHRU de Nancy. Un questionnaire environnemental a {\'{e}}t{\'{e}} distribu{\'{e}} {\`{a}} l'ensemble des parents des patients. Notre population a {\'{e}}t{\'{e}} divis{\'{e}}e en un groupe de 34 patients ayant eu une primo-d{\'{e}}tection {\`{a}} PA pr{\'{e}}coce avant l'{\^{a}}ge de 2ans et un groupe de 95 patients n'ayant pas eu de primo-d{\'{e}}tection {\`{a}} PA. 

R{\'{E}}SULTATS
Le groupe de patients ayant eu une primo-d{\'{e}}tection pr{\'{e}}coce {\`{a}} PA avait significativement un diagnostic de mucoviscidose plus pr{\'{e}}coce (1,5mois vs. 23,4mois ; p=0,0017). Ils {\'{e}}taient plus souvent diagnostiqu{\'{e}}s suite au d{\'{e}}pistage n{\'{e}}onatal (14,7 {\%} vs. 6,4 {\%} ; p=0,0453). Le chlore sudoral {\'{e}}tait plus {\'{e}}lev{\'{e}} au diagnostic (104,1mmol/l vs 88mmol/l ; p=0,0222). Ils {\'{e}}taient plus fr{\'{e}}quemment homozygote pour la mutation F508del (61,8 {\%} vs. 40,9 {\%} ; p=0,0452). Ils avaient {\'{e}}galement un nombre plus {\'{e}}lev{\'{e}} de bact{\'{e}}ries dans leurs s{\'{e}}cr{\'{e}}tions respiratoires (1,8 vs. 1,3 ; p=0,0317), de Staphylocoque aureus meticilline sensible (60 {\%} vs. 33,7 {\%} ; p=0,0177) et d'Haemophilus influenzae (80 {\%} vs. 51,6 {\%} ; p=0,0061). Il ne ressort pas de facteurs environnementaux int{\'{e}}rieurs et/ou ext{\'{e}}rieurs corr{\'{e}}l{\'{e}}s avec l'acquisition pr{\'{e}}coce de PA. 

CONCLUSION
Nous n'avons pu retrouv{\'{e}} de facteur de risque environnemental de primo-d{\'{e}}tection pr{\'{e}}coce {\`{a}} PA. Malgr{\'{e}} cela, la source de PA primitive se trouverait bien dans l'environnement quotidien des patients atteints de mucoviscidose {\'{e}}tant donn{\'{e}} son habitat aquatique. La contamination est certainement plurifactorielle quel que soit l'{\^{a}}ge. Les limites de cette {\'{e}}tude n{\'{e}}cessitent d'{\^{e}}tre prudent quant aux r{\'{e}}sultats. Les r{\`{e}}gles d'hygi{\`{e}}ne pr{\'{e}}conis{\'{e}}s dans le cadre de la prise en charge globale de la mucoviscidose ne doivent pas devenir une obsession ou emp{\^{e}}cher les parents de patients de vivre une vie sociale la plus normale possible.},

Although aerosolization of Tobramycin into the airway of CF patients improves outcomes, the lungs of CF patients, even those receiving antibiotic therapy, are persistently colonized by P. aeruginosa. Recent studies suggest that the antibiotic resistance of P. aeruginosa in the CF lung is due to the formation of drug resistant biofilms, which are defined as communities of microbes associated with surfaces or interfaces, and whose growth is facilitated by thick and dehydrated mucus in the CF lung. In this review, we discuss some of the current models used to study biofilm formation in the context of biotic surfaces, such as airway cells, as well as the contribution of host-derived factors, including DNA, actin and mucus, to the formation of these microbial communities. We suggest that better in vitro models are required, both to understand the interaction of P. aeruginosa with the host airway, and as models to validate new therapeutics, whether targeted at bacteria or host.},

abstract = {Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic bacteria causing a wide variety of nosocomial infections. The expression of virulence genes in the infection site plays an important pathophysiological role. The transcription of several virulence genes of P. aeruginosa is controlled by a regulatory mechanism depending on bacterial density, named quorum-sensing (QS). Two QS systems, las and rhl, were identified in P. aeruginosa. Each system is defined by a couple of a regulation protein and an autoinducer enzyme: LasR/LasI and RhlR/RhlI for the las and rhlr QS systems, respectively. The autoinducer enzyme contributes to the synthesis of small molecules, the acyl homoserin lactones (AHLs) which easily diffuse through bacterial membranes. When they reach a critical level, the AHLs are linked to the regulation protein. The resulting complex activates the transcription of multiple virulence genes. This activation can amplify and synchronise the virulence of the whole bacterial population. The AHLs also have an immuno-modulation activity, which plays a role in the pathophysiology of the infection. The role of the QS was experimentally demonstrated in different animal models of P. aeruginosa infections. In humans, the expression of the QS and the presence of AHL were detected in respiratory specimens of cystic fibrosis patients infected by P. aeruginosa. The effect of QS in other types of infection requires further studies. As a whole, the knowledge of the molecular mechanisms of QS offers the opportunity to develop new therapeutic targets to attenuate the virulence of strains during P. aeruginosa infections. {\textcopyright} 2004 Soci{\'{e}}t{\'{e}} de r{\'{e}}animation de langue fran{\c{c}}aise.

abstract = {Cystic fibrosis (CF) manifests in the lungs resulting in chronic microbial infection. Most mor-bidity and mortality in CF is due to cycles of pulmonary exacerbations—episodes of acute inflammation in response to the lung microbiome—which are difficult to prevent and treat because their cause is not well understood. We hypothesized that longitudinal analyses of the bacterial component of the CF lung microbiome may elucidate causative agents within this community for pulmonary exacerbations. In this study, 6 participants were sampled thrice-weekly for up to one year. During sampling, sputum, and data (antibiotic usage, spi-rometry, and symptom scores) were collected. Time points were categorized based on rela-tion to exacerbation as Stable, Intermediate, and Treatment. Retrospectively, a subset of were interrogated via 16S rRNA gene sequencing. When samples were examined categori-cally, a significant difference between the lung microbiota in Stable, Intermediate, and Treat-ment samples was observed in a subset of participants. However, when samples were examined longitudinally, no correlations between microbial composition and collected data (antibiotic usage, spirometry, and symptom scores) were observed upon exacerbation onset. In this study, we identified no universal indicator within the lung microbiome of exacerbation onset but instead showed that changes to the CF lung microbiome occur out-side of acute pulmonary episodes and are patient-specific.},

abstract = {The airways of cystic fibrosis (CF) patients are chronically colonized by patient-specific polymicrobial communities. The conditions and nutrients available in CF lungs affect the physiology and composition of the colonizing microbes. Recent work in bioreactors has shown that the fermentation product 2,3-butanediol mediates cross-feeding between some fermenting bacteria and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and that this mechanism increases bacterial current production. To examine bacterial fermentation in the respiratory tract, breath gas metabolites were measured and several metagenomes were sequenced from CF and non-CF volunteers. 2,3-butanedione was produced in nearly all respiratory tracts. Elevated levels in one patient decreased during antibiotic treatment, and breath concentrations varied between CF patients at the same time point. Some patients had high enough levels of 2,3-butanedione to irreversibly damage lung tissue. Antibiotic therapy likely dictates the activities of 2,3-butanedione-producing microbes, which suggests a need for further study with larger sample size. Sputum microbiomes were dominated by P. aeruginosa, Streptococcus spp. and Rothia mucilaginosa, and revealed the potential for 2,3-butanedione biosynthesis. Genes encoding 2,3-butanedione biosynthesis were disproportionately abundant in Streptococcus spp, whereas genes for consumption of butanedione pathway products were encoded by P. aeruginosa and R. mucilaginosa. We propose a model where low oxygen conditions in CF lung lead to fermentation and a decrease in pH, triggering 2,3-butanedione fermentation to avoid lethal acidification. We hypothesize that this may also increase phenazine production by P. aeruginosa, increasing reactive oxygen species and providing additional electron acceptors to CF microbes.},

abstract = {The structure and dynamics of bacterial communities in the airways of persons with cystic fibrosis (CF) remain largely unknown. We characterized the bacterial communities in 126 sputum samples representing serial collections spanning 8-9 y from six age-matched male CF patients. Sputum DNA was analyzed by bar-coded pyrosequencing of the V3-V5 hypervariable region of the 16S rRNA gene, defining 662 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) from {\textgreater}633,000 sequences. Bacterial community diversity decreased significantly over time in patients with typically progressive lung disease but remained relatively stable in patients with a mild lung disease phenotype. Antibiotic use, rather than patient age or lung function, was the primary driver of decreasing diversity. Interpatient variability in community structure exceeded intrapatient variability in serial samples. Antibiotic treatment was associated with pronounced shifts in community structure, but communities showed both short- and long-term resilience after antibiotic perturbation. There was a positive correlation between OTU occurrence and relative abundance, with a small number of persistent OTUs accounting for the greatest abundance. Significant changes in community structure, diversity, or total bacterial density at the time of pulmonary exacerbation were not observed. Despite decreasing community diversity in patients with progressive disease, total bacterial density remained relatively stable over time. These findings show the critical relationship between airway bacterial community structure, disease stage, and clinical state at the time of sample collection. These features are the key parameters with which to assess the complex ecology of the CF airway.},

Selon les besoins, les analyses bioinformatiques peuvent fournir de nombreuses indications qualitatives et quantitatives sur les communaut{\'{e}}s microbiennes et microfauniques d{\'{e}}tect{\'{e}}es dans les {\'{e}}chantillons. D'une mani{\`{e}}re g{\'{e}}n{\'{e}}rale, trois grands types de r{\'{e}}sultats sont obtenus{\_}: la richesse de la diversit{\'{e}}, sa composition taxonomique et les fonctions assum{\'{e}}es par les taxons. En {\'{e}}cologie microbienne, les notions de diversit{\'{e}} alpha et beta renseignent sur la richesse et la composition taxonomique des communaut{\'{e}}s d'un seul {\'{e}}chantillon, ou entre les communaut{\'{e}}s de diff{\'{e}}rents {\'{e}}chantillons. Lors d'une premi{\`{e}}re {\'{e}}tape, plusieurs indices de diversit{\'{e}} (Faith's, Chao1, Shannon, Simpson, etc.) permettent d'{\'{e}}valuer la richesse microbienne globale pour r{\'{e}}pondre {\`{a}} la question «L'{\'{e}}chantillon estil compos{\'{e}} de peu ou de beaucoup de populations microbiennes et microfauniques?». Ensuite, selon le niveau taxonomique retenu (r{\`{e}}gne, division, classe, ordre, famille, genre, esp{\`{e}}ces), la d{\'{e}}termination des proportions relatives associ{\'{e}}es {\`{a}} chacune des composantes taxonomiques d{\'{e}}tect{\'{e}}es permet de r{\'{e}}pondre {\`{a}} la question «Quelle est la composition globale ou d{\'{e}}taill{\'{e}}e des communaut{\'{e}}s d{\'{e}}tect{\'{e}}es dans l'{\'{e}}chantillon et quel est le rang occup{\'{e}} par chacune ?». Finalement, la connaissance de la composition taxonomique permet d'associer {\`{a}} un {\'{e}}chantillon, un potentiel fonctionnel th{\'{e}}orique d{\'{e}}coulant des taxons identifi{\'{e}}s. Suivez de mani{\`{e}}re pr{\'{e}}cise l'impact de vos r{\'{e}}gies et de vos pratiques agricoles sur les communaut{\'{e}}s microbiennes b{\'{e}}n{\'{e}}fiques ou pathog{\`{e}}nes de vos sols.Le LEM offre un service de caract{\'{e}}risation taxonomique qualitatif et quantitatif bas{\'{e}} sur des analyses cibl{\'{e}}es de m{\'{e}}tag{\'{e}}nomique r{\'{e}}alis{\'{e}}es avec la plateforme Illumina MiSeq 2X300pb. Ce service permet l'identification et la caract{\'{e}}risation de l'ensemble des populations de bact{\'{e}}ries, d'archaebact{\'{e}}ries, de champignons et de microfaune d'un environnement complexe tel un sol, un biofilm ou un tout autre {\'{e}}cosyst{\`{e}}me.},
